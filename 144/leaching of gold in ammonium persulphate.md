## Thiosulphate Stability In Gold Leaching Process
Ammonium thiosulphate is an alternative gold leaching Laaviant used to replace cyanide.The current problem of thiosulphate gold leaching is the high reagent consumption,To understand the decomposition chemistry of thiosulphate,solution stability tests.use of thiosulfate in gold leachingThe gold industry has been seeking alternative reagents for leaching gold from low grade ores for the past 25 years.The cost and transport of cyanide,the poor recovery of gold from carbonaceous ores,the lack of selectivity of cyanide towards copper minerals and the cost of waste treatment are real factors which can make cyanide unattractive in some circumstances.
