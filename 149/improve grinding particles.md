## Five tips on mill liners to improve grinding profitability.
When the grinding mill turns,it is the mill lining’s job to grip and lift the charge to create the desired charge motion and ensure that as much of that energy as possible is transformed into efficient grinding.We started off with the tips on improving grinding profitability already in our first blog post and cover now the remaining two aspects: optimized design and maintenance.Feed processing technologyGrinding process is an important procedure to improve feed quality during feed processing and is also one of the necessary means to make rational usage of feed.The size of the crushed particle should be determined according to the types of raw materials,the type of feeding animals,growth stage,and technological requirements.
