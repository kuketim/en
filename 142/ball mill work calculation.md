## Bond Work Index
Ball mill design requires a Bond work index,BWi,for ball mills at the correct passing size; SAG mill design requires an appropriate SAG test,for example,SPI (Chapter 5).Flotation design needs a valid measure of kinetics for each sample,including the maximum attainable recovery and rate constants for each mineral ( Chapter 12 ).ball mill working principle and calculationBall Mill Working Principle And Calculation.This type of mill uses the same principle as a vsi crusher tower mill tower mills often called vertical mills stirred mills or regrind mills are a more efficient means of grinding material at smaller particle sizes and can be
