## Cement manufacturing
Cement is typically made from limestone and clay or shale.These raw materials are extracted from the quarry crushed to a very fine powder and then blended in the correct proportions.This blended raw material is called the 'raw feed' or 'kiln feed' and is heated in a rotary kiln where it reaches a temperature of about 1400 C to 1500 C.Definitions of cementQuick definitions from WordNet (cement) noun: something that hardens to act as adhesive material noun: a building material that is a powder made of a mixture of calcined limestone and clay; used with water and sand or gravel to make concrete and mortar noun: concrete pavement is sometimes referred to as cement (&quot;They stood on the gray cement beside the pool&quot;)

The control cement mixture was proposed with water cement ratio of 0.5.Based on that,the cement pastes were modified by partially substituting water content with Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR.The Differences Between Cement,Concrete,and MortarCement,in general,adhesive substances of all kinds,but,in a narrower sense,the binding materials used in building and civil engineering construction.Cements of this kind are finely ground powders that,when mixed with water,set to a hard mass.Setting and hardening result from hydration,which is a chemical combination of the cement compounds with water that yields submicroscopic.

Cement is the basic material for constructions which is made from a mixture of elements that are found in natural materials such as limestone,marl and or clay.The History of Concrete and CementIn 1756,the British engineer John Smeaton made the first modern concrete (hydraulic cement) by adding pebbles as a coarse aggregate and mixing powered brick into the cement.Smeaton developed his new formula for concrete in order to build the third Eddystone Lighthouse,but his innovation drove a huge surge in the use of concrete in modern structures.

## Recycling of PET bottles as fine aggregate in concrete.
The use of fibers made by waste PET bottles in fiber reinforced concrete is also able to control the plastic shrinkage cracking in cement based composites (Ochi et al.2007,Silva et al.2005).Plastic shrinkage cracking is a primary cause of reduced performance in cement based composites ( Balaguru and Shah,1992,Bentur and Mindess,1990.• Global cement production top countries 2019 StatistaThis statistic shows the worldwide cement production,by major producing countries,from 2015 to 2019.In 2019,cement production in the United States amounted to some 89 million metric tons.Thus.
