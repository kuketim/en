## Fly ash
Fly ash or flue ash,also known as pulverised fuel ash in the United Kingdom,is a coal combustion product that is composed of the particulates (fine particles of burned fuel) that are driven out of coal fired boilers together with the flue gases.Ash that falls to the bottom of the boiler's combustion chamber (commonly called a firebox) is called bottom ash.Duke Seeks Permit To Process And Reuse Coal Ash From. · Duke eventually will be required to process a total of about 900,000 tons of coal ash a year at the three sites.Duke already recycles about 40 percent of the coal ash it generates in North.

## Coal Combustion Products
Coal fly ash has many of the chemical properties of portland cement.It includes constituents such as silica,alumina,iron and other oxides.These characteristics allow fly ash to replace portland cement in concrete products or to be used in the production of bricks.Ash typically needs no process ing and can be delivered from the powerRecycling Fly Ash Turns a Lump of Coal into Sustainable,…Fly ash makes up more than half of coal waste,and 99% of it is filtered by power plant exhaust stacks.But rather than divert that filtered ash to landfills,one solution gaining traction is ash recycling.
