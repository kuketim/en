Ground slurry from the trash screen enters this EXAMPLE Agitated Leach circuit at a rate of 35.5 cubic meters per hour,and 45% solids.The slurry passes through each of the four tanks,and should remain in each tank for a period of approximately 12 hours.Each tank is 8 meters in diameter by 8.5 meters high,and is designed to hold approximately 350 cubic meters of material.FansFor practical applications,that's less than $.01 per hour,using standard electric costs.” Some fans have circuit boards and optic sensors that adjust to run faster or slower depending on the weight of the blade installed,and most come with wall or hand held controls.
