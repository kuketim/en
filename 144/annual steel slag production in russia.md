## Alumina Production in Russia Part I
As of Janu,Russia was operating six alumina production lines (Table I); in 1994,they combined to produce nearly two million tonnes of alumina.Of this figure,67% was produced from the bauxite (including high silica content bauxite); the rest was produced from nepheline materials (Table II).Steel7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;About 40% of the iron containing materials used in steel production are now from recycled sources.It is estimated that recycling one tonne of steel saves 1.1 tonnes of iron ore,0.6 tonnes of coal and 0.5 tonnes of limestone,with an overall energy saving of 75%.Date last amended: 26th September 2016
