## Strontium
Strontium was recognized as a new element in 1790 when Adair Crawford analyzed a mineral sample from a lead mine near Strontian,Scotland.Until then scientists had thought strontium and barium were the same element,and only barium’s existence had been recognized.The mineral took its name from the Scottish town and was called strontianite (strontium carbonate).#3823&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Strontium aluminate (SrAl 2 O 4) Strontium carbonate (SrCO 3) Strontium chloride (SrCl 2) Strontium fluoride (SrF 2) Strontium hydroxide [Sr(OH) 2] Strontium nitrate [Sr(NO 3) 2] Strontium oxide (SrO) Strontium sulfate (SrSO 4) Strontium titanate (SrTiO 3) Interesting facts: It does not occur as a free element in nature.It is softer than calcium.

## Introduction List of Most Common Carbonate Minerals
4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This is an introduction list that covers the most common carbonates minerals which are compounds of carbon dioxide (frequently called carbonic acid) with oxides of metals.In naming individual carbonates,the name of the metal is used; but if the name of the oxide of the metal is better known,as lime,for example,which is calcium oxide,the name of the oxide will be used instead of the name.Strontium Carbonate PowderStrontium Carbonate is commonly used with chlorine donors to create red flames and in pyrotechnic compositions.Carbonates work as an acid reducer in chlorate compositions.Although they are not interchangeable with Strontium Carbonate,other red coloring agents are strontium sulfate,the oxidizer strontium nitrate,and the salt strontium chloride.
