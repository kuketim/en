The attrition mill is a device for mechanically reducing solid particle size by intense agitation of a slurry of material being milled and coarse milling media.For example,in 10 hours of milling,specific surfaces of 40 and 25 m2 g were obtained for alumina and barite,corresponding to 38 and 56 nm equivalent spherical diameter,respectively.Milling Plant Газогенераторы МСДThe mill air quantity is proportional to the mill load,whereas the bypass air increases at low loads to keep up the velocities in classifiers and coal lines.Because of the large amount of coal inside the mill at all times,it is not possible to control the mill output by feeder speed variation as in vertical mills; however,it is possible by the variation of the mill air.
