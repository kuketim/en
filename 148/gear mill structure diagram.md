## Gear
A gear or cogwheel is a rotating machine part having cut teeth or,in the case of a cogwheel,inserted teeth (called cogs),which mesh with another toothed part to transmit torque.Geared devices can change the speed,torque,and direction of a power source.Gears almost always produce a change in torque,creating a mechanical advantage,through their gear ratio,and ‚Ä¶Gear GeneratorGear Generator is a tool for creating involute spur gears and download them in DXF or SVG format.In addition it let you compose full gear layouts with connetcted gears to design multiple gears system with control of the input outpu

## Gear
A gear or cogwheel is a rotating machine part having cut teeth or,in the case of a cogwheel,inserted teeth (called cogs),which mesh with another toothed part to transmit torque.Geared devices can change the speed,torque,and direction of a power source.Gears almost always produce a change in torque,creating a mechanical advantage,through their gear ratio,and thus may b
