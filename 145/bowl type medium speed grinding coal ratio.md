## Coal mill pulverizer in thermal power plants
10.Bowl Mill Bowl mills are employed to pulverize the pre crushed raw coal to the required fineness before it is admitted into the boiler furnace for combustion.The mill output can be easily varied,as per the turndown ratio from its minimum to maximum load.Crushed raw coal at a controlled rate is fed into the revolving bowl of the Bowl Mill.How it Works: Crushers,Grinding Mills and Pulverizers.How it Works: Crushers,Grinding Mills and Pulverizers Ken Thayer &amp;vert; J Crushers,grinding mills and pulverizers are types of grinding equipment used to transform or reduce a coarse material such as stone,coal,or slag into a smaller,finer material.

## Crusher
4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,sand or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.COAL MILL PULVERIZER in THERMAL POWER PLANTS …13.1.Fineness : 13.1.Fineness Fineness is an indicator of the quality of the pulverizer action.Specifically,fineness is a measurement of the percentage of a coal sample that passes through a set of test sieves usually designated at 50,100,and 200 mesh A 70% coal sample passing through a 200 mesh screen indicates optimum mill performance.
