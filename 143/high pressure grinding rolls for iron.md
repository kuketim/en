## High pressure grinding rolls (HPGR)
High pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) are used for size reduction or rocks and ores.They compress the feed material between two rotating rollers,one of which is in a fixed position and another roller that is floating.The two rotating rollers generate such a highHigh Pressure Grinding Rolls in the mining sector.High pressure grinding rolls,also called roller presses,have been used in the treatment of iron ore,copper (Fig.),gold,diamond and various other ore types for many years.Contrary to conventional crushing rolls,the particles are broken by compression in a packed particle bed,and

## On a roll
A few years ago,Freeport McMoRan Inc.(FCX) chose high pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) over a semi autogenous grinding mill for the expansion of its Morenci open pit copper mine in Arizona.In February of this year,Iamgold announced it too would be using HPGRs …Why your High Pressure Grinding Roll needs to skew.To accommodate this uneven pressure Enduron&#174; High Pressure Grinding Rolls utilise a unique spring loaded lateral wall which not only reduces the edge effect (maintaining a gap of as little as 1mm) but is specifically designed to facilitate roll skew.As shown above,an uneven feed will lead to high pressure on one side and not enough on the other.
