## Reactions in the cement kiln
The cement clinker calcination is an important step in the cement production process.It mainly occurs in cement kiln and can be roughly divided into six reaction stages,namely drying,preheating,chemical decomposition,exothermic reaction,sintering and cooling.(PDF) Production of Cement Engr Sajid ChaudharyAcademia.edu is a platform for academics to share research papers.
