## Conveyor Belt Installation,Maintenance & Troubleshooting.
As the belt is fed on,the tension at the roll tends to build up due to the weight of the belt on the slope.For this reason,some method of braking is required.Customary practice is to use a belt clamp,mounted on the conveyor structure,through which the belt is threaded.Where the slope is very long,additional clamps should be spacedHow To Calculate Conveyor Belt TensionsThis video explains how to calculate conveyor belt tensions in bulk materials handling conveyors,with emphasis on effective tension,Te,and slack side tension,T2.It also explains how to convert effective tension into required conveyor drive power.Use this video in.
