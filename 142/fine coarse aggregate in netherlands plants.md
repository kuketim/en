## EMPLOYMENT OF RECYCLED AGGREGATES IN CONCRETE …
At first,it is necessary to underline that from rubble both the fine fraction (RA f) and the coarse fraction (RA c) of the RA can be obtained,but as a rule the RA fine fraction is not used in concrete,being its quality too low,and is replaced by natural sand (NA f cWhat is Aggregates Aggregate Definition &amp; its Types.(1.) Aggregate Types on the basis of Grain Size.This is the most common classification,where in two types of aggregates are distinguished: (Fine and Coarse).(i) Fine Aggregates.In the Fine Aggregates,the grain size lies between 4.75 mm and 0.15 mm.
