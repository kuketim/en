## Cobalt extraction
Cobalt extraction refers to the techniques used to extract cobalt from its ores and other compound ores.Several methods exist for the separation of cobalt from copper and nickel.They depend on the concentration of cobalt and the exact composition of the used oreCopper Cobalt oresCopper is separated from the cobalt in the bulk concentrate by raising the pH up to at least 11 which depresses the cobalt minerals.Cobalt depression can be enhanced by small cyanide dosages.If the cobalt is found with chalcopyrite,bulk flotation can be carried out with xanthate at pH 10,and separation made at pH 4 with an amine and combinations of fatty acid to recover the cobalt minerals.
