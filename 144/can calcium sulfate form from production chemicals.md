a) Chemical interactions with other substances,especially substances used in organic production: There are no known problematic interactions between calcium sulfate and other substances used in organic production when applied in the manner described in thisSulfite processHistory The use of wood to make pulp for paper began with the development of mechanical pulping in the 1840s by Charles Fenerty in Nova Scotia [1] and by F.G.Keller [2] in Germany.Chemical processes quickly followed,first with Julius Roth's use of sulfurous acid to treat wood in 1857,followed by Benjamin Chew Tilghman's US patent on the use of calcium bisulfite,Ca(HSO 3) 2,to pulp wood.
