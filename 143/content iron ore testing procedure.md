## Characterization of Chemical Composition and.
The study aimed at investigating the chemical composition and microstructure of raw iron ore from the deposits in Muko area (south western Uganda).The quality of this iron ore was evaluated to establish its suitability to serve as a raw material for iron production.Samples were taken from the six hills of Muko ore deposits and tests carried out to establish their composition and properties.Iron Ore Fines Iron Ore Cargoes Early Implementation of.Whether an iron ore cargo falls under the new Schedule for IOF or the amended Schedule for iron ore will be determined by the particle size distribution and goethite content of the material (an iron bearing oxide mineral).The research concluded that iron ore cargoes with a goethite content of 30% and greater were not liable to liquefy,
