## how to make calcium carbonate from eggshells
Elemental Amount: Eggshells contain calcium carbonate,and approximately 40% of it is absorbable.The amount absorbed is called the elemental amount.Calcium and magnesium need to be taken in at least equal amounts,and some people require more magnesium than calcium depending upon how much calcium they obtain from foods.Chicken eggshell as suitable calcium source at home.AIM: Taken into consideration that the deficiency of calcium (Ca) in the diet is a common problem,the aim of this work was to study the chicken eggshell as Ca source at home.It was evaluated: (1) different mechanisms to process eggshells and find an easy way to determine the required amount of Ca at home and; (2) the flavor and the texture for eggshell fortified food.
