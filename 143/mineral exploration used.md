## Mining
Mining Mining Prospecting and exploration: Various techniques are used in the search for a mineral deposit,an activity called prospecting.Once a discovery has been made,the property containing a deposit,called the prospect,is explored to determine some of the more important characteristics of the deposit.Among these are its size,shape,orientation in space,and location with respect.Mineral ExplorationLogging field technique used in mineral exploration to analyze the geologic formations penetrated by a drill hole.If the hole has been drilled by using coring techniques,the core provides a visual record of the formations and rock types encountered.The description.

## Mining engineering
Mineral exploration is the process of finding ores (commercially viable concentrations of minerals) to mine.Mineral exploration is a much more intensive,organized and professional form of mineral prospecting and,though it frequently uses the services of prospecting,the process of mineral exploration,on the whole,is much more involved.Illustrative Geophysical Exploration Methods PosterCore drills are used frequently in mineral exploration where the coring may be several hundred to several thousand feet in length.The core samples are recovered and examined by geologists and geophysicists for mineral percentages,lithology,petrology,and stratigraphic contact points.
