## Mill (grinding)
A VSI mill throws rock or ore particles against a wear plate by slinging them from a spinning center that rotates on a vertical shaft.This type of mill uses the same principle as a VSI crusher.Tower mill.Tower mills,often called vertical mills,stirred mills or regrind mills,are a more efficient means of grinding material at smaller particle sizes,and can be used after ball mills â€¦Clearing Up PCV Valve Problems MotorWeekWe see more of it here in the valve cover off of that engine.The engine was destroyed,all from failure to service the PCV system.Check it,all of the parts of it,at least once a year or every 12,000 miles.If you have a question or comment,write to me.The address is MotorWeek,Owings Mills,MD,21117.
