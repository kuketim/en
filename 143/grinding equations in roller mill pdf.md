16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;METAL FORMING SCIENCE AND PRACTICE The flattening rate W is a function of the real area of contact area ratio A and the ratio p Y of the mean contact pressure to the plane strain yield stress of the strip,i.e.= A Y p W W,(4.4) The theoretical flattening rate W is in the range 1 8,increasing with increasing mean pressure and falling with increasing area of contact ratio.Calculate and Select Ball Mill Ball Size for Optimum …4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do.Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize “just in case”.Well,this safety factor can cost you much in recovery and or mill liner wear and.
