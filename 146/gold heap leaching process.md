## Heap leaching
A process whereby valuable metals,usually gold and silver,are leached from a heap,or pad,of crushed ore by leaching solutions percolating down through the heap and collected from a sloping,impermeable liner below the pad.Gold Silver Heap Leaching and Management Practices That.INDUSTRY STATUS The mining industry first became interested in the U.S.Bureau of Mines' developments in gold silver heap leaching technology in the late 1960's,and the first'commercial cyanide heap leaching process was used at the Carlin — 'A&quot; Gold Mine Company in northern Nevada on mine cutoff material.

## Gold Cyanidation
Many modern mines now use a &quot;de toxification&quot; process that converts cyanide into the less toxic cyanate before combining it with the mine tailings waste.In addition,the majority of cyanide gold mines use &quot;impermeable&quot; liners in their tailings ponds and underneath their heap leaching operations.How Cyanide Leaching is Used in Gold Mining.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The Cyanide Leaching Process has been the most widely used and most cost effective method of extracting gold from ore since the 1970’s.Most open pit gold mining operations around the world use a heap leaching to extract ores from these types of deposits.

## Gold Heap Leaching Process
Heap leaching (HL) is a flexible and economic mineral processing method,commonly used to extract gold from low grade gold ores.In this process,ore is firstly crushed to fine particles.By spraying leaching solution to the large piles,the gold containing solution is leached.Heap LeachingHow Did Heap Leaching Enter the Picture? In a research paper (,researcher Mark Smith suggests the first use of heap leaching occurred at the Bluebird copper oxide mine during in the late 1960s,with other western United States gold mines following suit in the 1970s.

Gold Mine Heap Leaching Process.Crushed by jaw crushers and cone crushers to a certain particle size ( 50mm),raw ore is directly sent for heaping or granulated (to make finer particles agglomerate into coarse powder),and then transported to the ore heap site for heap construction.On the laid ore heap site,the heap system is set up.CYANIDE HEAP LEACHINGThe perfection of the cyanide process largely replaced amalgamation with mercury that had previously been the main method of extracting gold from ore.Cyanidation has also become crucial since 1970 in gold recovery from low grade deposits through heap leaching.It should be noted that cyanide is extremely toxic and must be handled with special.

## Heap Leaching
Heap leaching is an industrial mining process of separating precious metals,copper and other minerals from ores.It involves a series of chemical processes through which the mineral ores are piled in the form of a heap and a leach solution is spread over the ore surface to leach metal from the heap.Heap Leaching of Gold and Silver OresLarge scale gold and silver heap leaching began with the first Cortez heap leach in 1969.While many projects have come and gone,Cortez is still going.Nevada was the “birthplace” of modern gold heap leaching in the late 1960s,and is only recently giving up its dominance of this technology.

## Heap leaching
Heap leaching is an industrial mining process to extract precious metals,copper,uranium,and other compounds from ore via a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and then re separates them after their division from other earth materials.Similar to in situ mining,heap leach mining differs in that it places ore on a liner,then adds the chemicals via drip systems to the.
