In this paper,the brightness of fly ash is improved by carbon removal by heating and iron containing oxides removal by acid treatment using a two step method to realize the application of fly ash as filler or coating in the future,which not only increases the range of resource utilization of fly ash,but also reduces dust pollution.The modification results show that the brightness of fly.An analytical indoor experimental study on the effect of …The PV performance result shows that the short circuit current degraded by about 18% when stone dust was dry deposited on acrylic plastic and by about 9% on the low iron glass.An alarming increase in degradation was observed when stone dust was wet deposited on the various coupons with about 92% degradation recorded on acrylic plastic and about 91% on the low iron glass.
