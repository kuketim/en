## Newbie needs some advise
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Hi,I spent a couple of months researching the chemical process of recovering gold and platinum.I downloaded printed and put the book Refinin precious metals wastes by cm hoke into a binder.I read it a couple of times still not completely understanding but that.2: Atoms,Molecules,and Ions (Exercises)Solutions 1 Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties,including mass.Thus,the concept of isotopes,in which an element has different masses,was a violation of the original idea.To account for the existence of isotopes.

## Standard enthalpy of formation
The standard enthalpy of formation or standard heat of formation of a compound is the change of enthalpy during the formation of 1 mole of the substance from its constituent elements,with all substances in their standard states.The standard pressure value p ⦵ = 10 5 Pa (= 100 kPa = 1 bar) is recommended by IUPAC,although prior to 1982 the value 1.00 atm (101.325 kPa) was used.The Cell PotentialThe voltmeter at the very top in the gold color is what measures the cell voltage,or the amount of energy being produced by the electrodes.This reading from the voltmeter is called the voltage of the electrochemical cell.This can also be called the potential cell.
