## What is Water Cement Ratio?
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;What is Water Cement Ratio? Water Cement Ratio means the ratio between the weight of water to the weight of cement used in concrete mix.Normally water cement ratio falls under 0.4 to 0.6 as per IS C (2009) for nominal mix (M10,M15 ….How to Calculate the Water to Cement RatioA low water to cement ratio is the number one issue effecting concrete quality.Low water cement ratio impacts all of the desired properties of concrete listed in the desired properties of concrete section.Use a maximum.50 water to cement ratio when concrete is exposed to freezing and thawing in a moist condition or to deicing chemicals per the 1997 Uniform Building Code.
