## Tekcrete Fast~ : Fiber reinforced,rapid setting sprayed.
【】：Fiber reinforced spayed concrete has been used for several years in civil and tunneling operations.Research conducted to reduce cure times and increase compressive and flexural strengths resulted in the development of Tekcrete Fast~,a cementitious product capable of obtaining 41 MPa compressive strength and 8 MPa flexural strength in only 3 h and reaching 7 d strengths of 62.Shotcrete supportShotcrete support 6 Kompen (1989) carried out bending tests on slabs of unreinforced shotcrete and shotcrete reinforced with ‘Dramix’ 1 steel fibres,shown in Figure 5.The shotcrete had an unconfined compressive strength,determined from tests on cubes
