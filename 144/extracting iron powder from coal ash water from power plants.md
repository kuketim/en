## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish black sedimentary rock,formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements; chiefly hydrogen,sulfur,oxygen,and nitrogen.Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.Cleaner extraction of alumina from coal fly ash: Baking …Unfortunately,coal is also responsible for a large amount of coal fly ash (CFA) and significantly contributes to environmental pollution.Thermal power plants produce more than 800 Mt of CFA from coal combustion per annum worldwide.

How Does a Coal Power Plant Work.The coalfired process requires three different steps to turn energy released from burning coal to generating electricity for consumption Coal fired power plants while producing power require a lot of water and produce a lot of pollutants like ash and CO2UG Mat Coal Bottom Ash Boiler Slag Recycled Materials …Pyrites,which are more prevalent is high sulfur coal,are typically removed from coal during pulverizing and or cleaning operations prior to burning.Commingling the rejected pyrite with bottom ash is a practice at some power plants.Material handling operations

## waste processing machinery for coal production
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground.Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s,has been widely used to generate electricity.Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production.Control of Sox Nox Coal Fired Power Plants• Indian Coal have Sulphur content of about 0.2 to 0.3 % and hence Power Plants using only Indian Coal never gave any importance for So2 emissions.• In fact no specific Environmental Standards were Prescribed for SO2 Emissions earlierCities.
