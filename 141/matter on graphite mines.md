## Graphite: Mineral information,data and localities.
Graphite usually occurs in flakes in metamorphosed rocks rich in carbon,but it can also be found in veins and in pegmatites.Where large deposits are found it is mined and used as an industrial lubricant and for 'lead' in pencils.The crystallinity depends on theGraphite Mining in the US Companies to Watch INNJul 15,2021&#0183;&#32;The United Minerals graphite mine in Montana was an amorphous carbon product,not crystalline flake or vein graphite The last production of flake graphite,
