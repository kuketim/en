## Zinc (Zn)
Zinc Zinc is a lustrous bluish white metal.It is found in group IIb of the periodic table.It is brittle and crystalline at ordinary temperatures,but it becomes ductile and malleable when heated between 110 C and 150 C.It is a fairly reactive metal that will combine with oxygen and other non metals,and will react with dilute acids to release hydrogen.Aluminum Construction and Building The Aluminum AssociationAluminum was first used in quantity for building and construction in the 1920s The applications were primarily oriented toward decorative detailing and art deco structur The breakthrough came in 1930,when major structures within the Empire State Building were built with aluminum (including interior structures and the famous spire)
