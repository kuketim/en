## Concrete Mix Design M 20 Grade Of Concrete
Note: 1 The above recommended mix design must be verified,by actual cube tests.2 The mix design is based on the quality and grading of the materials actually supplied,by the client.17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;(Note 1: For every &#177;0.05 increase or decrease change in w c,the coarse aggregate proportion is to be changed by 0.01.If the w c is less than 0.5,volume of coarse aggregate is required to be increased to reduce the fine aggregate content in mix.If water cement ratio is more than 0.5,volume of coarse aggregate is to be reduced to increase the fine aggregate content.Strength of Concrete vs Grades of Cement14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;To design a concrete mix of the desired strength with available materials,the strength of cement is required at 7 days (IRC: 2008) 4 or at 28 days (IS: 1982) 5.Based on the strength values of cement,w c ratio is directly read from the available charts given in IRC &amp; IS.14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;concrete field testing technicians,grade I.Proof of this qualification shall be submitted with the course registration form.Certification Requirements A technician is required to pass a written examination to become certified.The examination will be given at the completion of the training course.The technician may take the
