## Gravity separation
Gravity separation is an industrial method of separating two components,either a suspension,or dry granular mixture where separating the components with gravity is sufficiently practical: i.e.the components of the mixture have different specific weight.All of the gravitational methods are common in the sense that they all use gravity as.Dense Medium Separation An Effective and Robust Pre,Pre concentration generally involves physical separation,where gravity separation and ore sorting processes have been the most effective Dense medium separation (DMS),synonymous with heavy medium separation (HMS),is a form of gravity concentration technology involving float sink separation
