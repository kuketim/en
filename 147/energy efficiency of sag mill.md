efficiency of the mill approximately 22%.For the mill with lower mill load and higher speed,the power draw of the different lifters also showed a slight difference.The energy requirement of Hi lifter also varied slightly than the other lifters.In this case,the Hi lifter showedSAG Mill Efficiency,Energy efficiency of Tumbling MillsThe energy efficiency of tumbling mills can be examined directly by looking at the motion of ore and grinding balls inside the mill.The makeup of the charge and the lifter bars attached to the inside of the mill shell can be designed particularly to maximize the mass of ore fractured per unit of energy spent.
