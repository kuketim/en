## Giant clam
Today these shells are on display in a museum in Northern Ireland.Another unusually large giant clam was found in 1956 off the Japanese island of Ishigaki.However,it was not examined scientifically before 1984.The shell's length was 115 centimetres (3 ft 9 in) and the weight of the shells and soft parts was 333 kilograms (734 lb).SAG Mill ComponentsOnce the basic operating conditions have been defined for the mill designer then,and only then,can he begin taking into account shell and head stresses and trunnion bearing sizes required to carry the load and to give the required openings for feeding and discharging the mills.Mill heads are key structural components of any grinding mill.
