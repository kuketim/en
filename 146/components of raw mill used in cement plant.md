Advantages of coal based thermal Power Plant.They can respond to rapidly changing loads without difficulty; A portion of the steam generated can be used as a process.RawmillA rawmill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into &quot;rawmix&quot; during the manufacture of cement.Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln,which transforms it into clinker,which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The rawmilling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement,and has a large effect upon the.
