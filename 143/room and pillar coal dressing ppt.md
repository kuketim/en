Coal mining in the United States has nearly always operated with a room and pillar layout,although originally operated with significantly more man power.[9] Room and pillar mining of gypsum was used in Iowa beginning in 1892,and was phased out of use in 1927 due to low recovery and development of technologies that made surface mining more practical,safe,and cost effective.Roles and Responsibilities of a Store Manager4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A store manager takes care of the day to day operations of the store and ensures maximum profitability for his store.In simpler words a retail store is a store manager’s baby.Hierarchy.General Manager ↑ Store Manager ↑ All employees of the store (Floor manager,cashier,Department manager,Asst Store manager) Gender Preference.Both.

Room and pillar mining often leads to retreat mining,in which supporting pillars are removed as miners retreat,allowing the room to cave in,thereby loosening more ore.Additional sub surface mining methods include hard rock mining,which is mining of hard rock (igneous,metamorphic or sedimentary) materials,bore hole mining,drift and fill.
