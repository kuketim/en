## RORB software for runoff routing
The RORB runoff routing software was developed within the Water Group of the Department of Civil Engineering by Eric Laurenson and Russell Mein.The latest version (RORB Version 6.18,2012) is the result of a collaboration between Monash University (Russell Mein) and Sinclair Knight Merz (Rory.Industrial Solutions Autogenous,Hydraulic cylinders installed in the base of the bearing allow lifting and positioning of the entire mill in order to compensate for foun dation settlement or to install or remove bearing shoes without complicated supporting of the mill shell.Load cells in the base of the bearing allow the mill weight to be recorded.
