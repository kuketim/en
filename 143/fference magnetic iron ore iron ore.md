## sintering vs pelleting
Iron Ore Processing for the Blast Furnace.A pellet plant contains a series of balling drums where the iron ore concentrate is formed into soft pellets,in much the same manner that one rolls a snowball,to make a pellet about the size of a marble (between 1 4&quot; and 1 2&quot;).steel FACTS18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;iron is combined with carbon,recycled steel and small amounts of other elements,it is transformed into a much stronger material called steel,used in a huge range of human made applications.Steel can be times stronger than iron.

## Types of Iron Ore: Hematite vs.Magnetite INN
As a result,this type of iron ore ore must be concentrated before it can be used to produce steel.Magnetite ore’s magnetic properties are helpful during this process.Learn to profit from base.Magnetite Iron Ore&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Magnetite Iron Ore blasting,FMG Iron ore mine Pilbara,WA Duration: 6:45.Hasan Asgari Recommended for you.Magnetic Fields with Magnetite taken from sand Magnetic Games Duration: 2 :44.
