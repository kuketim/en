## AMIT 135: Lesson 7 Ball Mills &amp; Circuits Mining Mill.
It is generally accepted that practical mill power (PM ) is a function of mill capacity and diameter,i.e.P M = Mill Constant * (Mill Diameter ) n where n = 0.3 to 0.5.It is evident that mill power is a function of the height at which the media is lifted and the density of the media,i.e.PM = K ρ b LD 2.5 where k is a proportionality constant.Energy Saving Ball MillWork Principle of Energy Saving Ball Mill: The main part of cylindrical energy saving grid ball mill is cylinder with small diameter and large length rotating slowly by the transmission device.The material is fed from the cylinder inlet and grinded by the impact of steel ball …

## Cement grinding Vertical roller mills versus ball mills
grinding of raw materials.The grinding efficiency of the vertical roller mill combined with an ability to dry,grind and classify within a single unit gives the vertical roller mill a decided advantage over a ball mill system.However,despite these benefits,applications of the vertical roller mill for cement grinding are less prevalent.Factors Affecting Ball Mill Grinding EfficiencyThe following are factors that have been investigated and applied in conventional ball milling in order to maximize grinding efficiency: a) Mill Geometry and Speed Bond (1954) observed grinding efficiency to be a function of ball mill diameter,and established empirical relationships for recommended media size and mill speed that take this factor into account.

## Ball Mills
In all ore dressing and milling Operations,including flotation,cyanidation,gravity concentration,and amalgamation,the Working Principle is to crush and grind,often with rob mill &amp; ball mills,the ore in order to liberate the minerals.In the chemical and process industries,grinding is an important step in preparing raw materials fBall MillsBall mills have been the primary piece of machinery in traditional hard rock circuits for 100+ years.They are proven workhorses,with discharge mesh sizes from ~40M to &lt;200M.Use of a ball mill is the best choice when long term,stationary milling can be justified by an operation.

It is generally accepted that practical mill power (PM ) is a function of mill capacity and diameter,i.e.P M = Mill Constant * (Mill Diameter ) n where n = 0.3 to 0.5.It is evident that mill power is a function of the height at which the media is lifted and the densityOrway Mineral Consultants Canada Ltd.Mississauga,ON.approach acknowledges grinding efficiency as the ratio of operating work index to that for a single stage.BM = Ball mill specific energy from T 80 1.7 mm to final product P 80,using Bond’s.and the coarse ore grinding index (M ia).Test data from the Bond ball mill work

## Calculate and Select Ball Mill Ball Size for Optimum Grinding
In Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do.Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize “just in case”.Well,this safety factor can cost you much in recovery and or mill liner wear and …Addition of pebbles to a ball mill to improve grinding.When the proportion of pebbles in the mill charge was low (up to 30%),the larger pebbles wore away significantly faster than expected,based on a constant surface wear rate.This could be due to size segregation in the mill.CITATION.Nkwanyana S and Loveday B.Addition of pebbles to a ball mill to improve grinding efficiency.
