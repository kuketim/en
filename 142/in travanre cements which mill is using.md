## Cement mill
A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage) is the equipment used to grind the hard,nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement.Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.Stage 4: Finish Process Cement ProductionEnergy consumption and output Cement mills are normally driven by electric motors.Modern installations draw power of 10 MW.The power (in kW) required to turn a ball mill is approximated by: P = 0.285 d (1.j) m n where d is the internal diameter in metres,j is the fraction of the mill volume occupied by media,m is the total mass of media in the mill,in tonnes,and n is the mill speed.
