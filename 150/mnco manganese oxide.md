## Manganese Chemicool
Manganese compounds have been used since ancient times.In the first century AD,Pliny the Elder,the Roman author,described how black powder (manganese dioxide) was used to manufacture colorless glass.(1) It is still used for the same purpose today.The first recognition of manganese&#39;s existence as a distinct&nbsp;.What is the oxidation number of manganese in MnO4 ,Mn2O3,and.21 Oct 2015.I&#39;ll show you how to find manganese&#39;s oxidation state in the first two compounds,and leave the last one to you as practice.In each of those three cases,you can determine the oxidation state of manganese by using the known oxidation state of oxygen and the overall charge of the ion,when that is the case.
