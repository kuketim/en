The mill product can either be finished size ready for processing,or an intermediate size ready for final grinding in a rod mill,ball mill or pebble mill.AG SAG mills can accomplish the same size reduction work as two or three stages of crushing and screening,a rod mill,and some or all of the work of a ball mill.Circulating Load Calculation FormulaHere is a formula that allows you to calculate the circulating load ratio around a ball mill and hydrocylone as part of a grinding circuit.For example your ball mill is in closed circuit with a set of cyclones.The grinding mill receives crushed ore feed.The pulp densities around your cyclone are sampled and known over an 8 hour shift,allowing to calculate corresponding to circulating load.

## Ball mill
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.MODELING THE SPECIFIC GRINDING ENERGY AND BALL MILL …21 CONCLUSIONS Continued In the present work,equations were also derived,giving: zthe ball mill power drawP as a function of its dimensions: internal mill diameter D and length L,zthe ball mill power drawP as a function of the feed D f (mm) and the product size d (mm),the Bond work index w i (kWh short ton) and the mill throughput T (short ton h),zthe ball mill dimensions (D and L),when.
