## The Process
Cement Grinding and Delivery A small proportion of gypsum ( 5%) is added to the clinker to regulate how the cement will set.The mixture is then finely grounded to obtain real cement.During this process,cement additives (Pozzolona a mineral material) is added.CementCement powder,here conditioned in bag,is mixed with fine and coarse aggregates and water.A cement is a binder,a substance used for construction that sets,hardens,and adheres to other materials to bind them together.Cement is seldom used on its own,but rather to bind sand and gravel (aggregate) together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate.
