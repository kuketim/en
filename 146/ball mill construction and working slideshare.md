## Ball Mill Application and Design
Ball mills are simple in design,consisting of horizontal slow rotating vessels half filled with grinding media of &#188;‚Äù to 1.5‚Äù.The particles to be milled are trapped between the grinding media or balls and are reduced iBall MillsWorking Principle &amp; Operation.The apparent difference in capacities between grinding mills (listed as being the same size) is due to the fact that there is no uniform method of designating the size of a mill,for example: a 5‚Ä≤ x 5‚Ä≤ Ball Mill has a working diameter of 5‚Ä≤ inside the liners and has 20 per cent more capacity than all other ball mills designated as 5‚Ä≤ x 5‚Ä≤ where the.
