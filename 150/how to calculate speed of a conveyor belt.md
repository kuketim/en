## Chain Conveyor Speed Calculation Physics Forums
Mar 22,2017&#0183;&#32;Okay this has has been driving me crazy I would like to know how a conveyor speed can be calculated on the basis of chain pitch,sprocket PCD & no of teeth and output RPM of gearmotor So here is a practical example I'm having to solve at the moment: I have to drive a conveyor at a speed,Line Speed Calculator Enercon IndustriesWhile both companies are running the same number of containers per minute,they are running at different conveyor line speeds Calculating conveyor speed in FPM is actually quite easy Divide the number of containers per minute by the number of containers per foot to get line speed in feet per minute

## Conveyor Capacity Engineering ToolBox
Conveyor capacity is determined by the belt speed,width and the angle of the belt and can be expressed as Q = ρ A v (1) where Q = conveyor capacity (kg s,lb s) ρ = density of transported material (kg m 3,lb ft 3) A = cross sectional area of the bulk solid on the belt (m 2,ft 2)
