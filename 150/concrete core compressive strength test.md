## Compressive Strength of Concrete Cores with Different,
In estimating compressive strength,a concrete core should preferably have the same dimensions as the standard cylinder,which is 150 mm in diameter and 300 mm in length However,the diameter of the core depends,among other things,on the size of the core drilling tool,whereas the length of the core varies with the thickness of the.COMPRESSION TEST REQUEST FOR CONCRETE CORESAge of concrete at time of core drilling Direction of drilling relative to casting* Conditions of storage# For designed mix,Mix ID shall be provided in accordance with chapter 7 Clause 21.22 of PAH.Grade : Strength (MPa) Mix description Designed slump (mm) :

Standard tests for determining the strength are Cube Test and Cylinder Test.As the name suggests,the difference in both the tests are in the shape of test specimens.In Indian,British and European standards,the Compressive strength of concrete is determined by testing concrete cubes referred as characteristic compressive strength whereas in American standards Cylinder strengths are used in.ConCrete Sampling and teSting National Precast,Cores for Compressive Strength Testing” This publication is designed to provide accurate and authoritative information,however the National Precast Concrete Association does not guarantee the validity or accuracy of any data,claim or opinion appearing in this publication

## Testing Concrete Cores
Concrete in the member represented by a core test shall be considered acceptable,if the average equivalent cube strength of the cores is equal to at least 85 percent of the cube strength of the grade of concrete specified for the corresponding age and noLow strength cylinder test resultsThus,if the specified compressive strength was 4000 psi,and the average of three cores was 3400 psi or higher—and no core strength was lower than 3000 psi—the concrete in the area represented by the core tests would be considered structurally adequate.
