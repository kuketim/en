## Stirred Mills Ultrafine Grinding
Figure 10.1 shows the difference in energy efficiency between a laboratory ball mill and a stirred mill grinding a gold ore using 6 mm diameter alumina balls as media.At a fine grind size there is a clear advantage in energy consumption for a stirred mill over the tumbling mill.However,as the grind size coarsens,the difference in specific energy required to achieve the grind lessens.HLMX Superfine Grinding MillThe anatomy of HLMX vertical mill.Grinding roller: Main component used for crushing and grinding materials.Together with the liner plate on the grinding plate,it can provide an effective grinding area.Grinding Plate: Component fixed on the output shaft of the reduction gear and where the grinding roller grinds materials.
