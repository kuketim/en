## Where is copper mined and how is it processed?
Great question.I was fascinated by this as a kid.Read over the webpages below.Their measures of largest may differ and hence the rankings but the mines listed are all good candidates.I included a few that are out of the top list but were on th.Copper Geoscience AustraliaThe copper ore usually contains a large amount of dirt,clay,and a variety of non copper bearing minerals.The first step is to remove some of this waste material.This process is called concentrating and is usually done by the flotation method.3 The ore is crushed in a series of cone crushers.

## Doe Run >Minerals & Metals >Other Minerals
Other Minerals We Mine While The Doe Run Company primarily extracts lead from its Missouri mines,we also serve as a copper mining company and a zinc mining company The ore we retrieve from the Viburnum Trend contains significant amounts of copper and zinc,so we are able to supply zinc and copper as concentrates to other,Copper Refining: From Ore to Market INNMined rock typically contains less than 1 percent copper.That means that to become a market ready copper product it must undergo a variety of physical and chemical processing steps.
