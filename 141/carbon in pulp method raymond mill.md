## Carbon in Pulp
Carbon in pulp process.Gold Carbon in pulp (CIP) production is the sequential leach,then absorption of gold from ore.During the CIP stage,pulp flows through several agitated tanks where sodium cyanide and oxygen have been added to dCarbon in Pulp PlantThe carbon advances countercurrently to the pulp.The carbon is maintained in suspension in the pulp by an internal air lift and mechanical agitation of the pulp,either with rakes or with axial flow propellers.This last arrangement is preferred because in case of power outages the pulp can be easily repulped after the power is restored.
