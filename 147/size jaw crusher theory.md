## Jaw Crushers
Jaw Crusher technology RETSCH Jaw Crushers are robust and powerful forced feed crushers.The feed material passes through the no rebound hopper and enters the crushing chamber.Size reduction takes place in the wedgeshaped area between the fixed crushing arm and one moved by an eccentric drive shaft.Jaw Crusher&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;TYPES OF JAW CRUSHERS In the dodge jaw crusher the moving jaw is pivoted at the bottom.As minimum movement is at the bottom it has a greater tendency to choke.In the Blake or jaw crusher the moveable jaw is pivoted at top.
