6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The development of cast iron as an engineering material is very much the story of the Darby family,who developed large scale methods of making this valuable material.The key step in smelting iron ore to raw metal is the reducing agent used: a reducing agent is a chemical that reacts with the iron oxides in the ore to release the iron in.The Mining Process Waihi GoldA slurry of ground ore,water and a weak cyanide solution is fed into large steel leach tanks where the gold and silver are dissolved.Following this leaching process the slurry passes through six adsorption tanks containing carbon granules which adsorb the gold and silver.
