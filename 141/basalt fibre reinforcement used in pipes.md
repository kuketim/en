## Basalt Fibre
The basalt fibre is made up of very fine fibres of basalt,and its composition consists of the minerals plagioclase,pyroxene and olivine.It has many of the applications of carbon and glass fibre.It is used as a textile for fireproofing in aerospace and automotive applications,and it can also be used as a composite reinforcement,including concrete reinforcement,in the construction of.Mix Basalt Chopped Fibers into Polymers and ConcreteStructural basalt composite components (such as pipes and rods) are made from unidirectional basalt reinforcement.In combination with its high specific strength (9.6 times as high as steel),high resistance to aggressive media,and high electrical insulting properties,this results in specialty products such as insulators for high voltage power lines.
