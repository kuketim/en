## Primary Crusher Selection &amp; Design
How you select your primary crusher will be based on factors like moisture content,maximum rock lump size,material density SG,abrasion index,degradability and it being prone to dusting or not.The crusher capacities given by manufacturers are typically in tons of 2,000 lbs.and are based on crushing limestone weighing loose about 2,700 lbs.per yard3 and having a specific gravity of 2.6.CrushersA gyratory crusher includes a solid cone set on a revolving shaft and placed within a hollow body,which has conical or vertical sloping sides.Material is crushed when the crushing surfaces approach each other and the crushed products fall through the discharging opening.Hammer crushers are used either as a one step primary crusher or as a secondary crusher for products from a primary crusher.
