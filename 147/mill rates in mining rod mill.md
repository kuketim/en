## Stamp mill
A stamp mill consists of a set of heavy steel (iron shod wood in some cases) stamps,loosely held vertically in a frame,in which the stamps can slide up and down.They are lifted by cams on a horizontal rotating shaft.As the cam moves from under the stamp,the stamp falls onto the ore below,crushing the rock,and the lifting process is repeated at the next pass of the cam.Ball Mill VS Rod MillRod mill are used widely in plant and are compared by us.This text will analyze the two equipment in some aspect.The grinding theory.Though used different medium (steel ball and steel rod are contained in ball mill and rod mill),the working theory of ball mill and rod mill …

## Optimization of mill performance by using
The performance of tumbling mills is sensitive to the volumetric mill filling which influences grinding media wear rates,throughput,power draw,and product grind size from the circuit.Each of these performance parameters peaks at different filling values.InTECHNICAL NOTES 8 GRINDING R.P.King8 3 Centrifugal force outward Fc mp&amp; 2 Dm 2 (8.1) &amp; is the angular velocity,mp is the mass of any particle (media or charge) in the mill and Dm is the diameter of the mill inside the liners.Gravitational force Fg mpg (8.2) The particle will remain again
