## Basalt and granite vs gabbro and rhyolite
Let's think about the differences between intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks for a bit Basalt is extrusive and comes out of volcanoes,but the lava had to come from somewhere This is where the concept of a "magma chamber" comes in the subsurface source of liquid rock to feed an extrusive volcanic eventDifference Between Rock and Mineral Compare the.5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Difference between Rock and Mineral.The difference between rock and mineral lays on their very nature.While a mineral is something that occurs naturally and has a defined chemical composition,a rock is a collection of minerals.Some rocks contain a single mineral while others contain a large number of different minerals.

## Can somebody please help me with this Earth Science,
Nov 13,2012&#0183;&#32;Can somebody please help me with this Earth Science? Consider the igneous rocks granite,rhyolite,and basalt,The difference between these two rocks is the environment in which they cool; granite cools slowly developing as a large crystalled rock in sub terranean batholiths while rhyolite cools rapidly at or near the surface.The Most Important Soil Amendment No One Ever Talks …Igneous rocks like basalt and granite have the highest mineral content,with basalt providing a greater balance of nutrients for optimal plant health and vitality.Created through the cooling and solidification of magma and lava,basalt is the rock material that makes up most of the soils around the world.
