## Production of Fine Polymer Powder under Cryogenic Conditions
Apr 4,2002 Abstract.In order to produce fine polymer powders,a special and unconventional cryogenic grinding system was established using liquid nitrogen,where a jetvortex mill was used as the grinding mill.The major feature of this grinding process is that heat generation during the grinding period was&nbspCryogenic Grinding &amp AttritorsCryogenic grinding is most effective when the product is sprayed with liquid nitrogen as it is being conveyed and introduced into the Attritor.An additional benefit of cryogenic milling in an internally agitated ball mill is the ability to fully immerse the product in liquid nitrogen during milling.
