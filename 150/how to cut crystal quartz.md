## Quartz crystal microbalance
A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) (also known as quartz microbalance (QMB),sometimes also as quartz crystal nanobalance (QCN)) measures a mass variation per unit area by measuring the change in frequency of a quartz crystal resonator.The resonance is disturbed by the addition or removal of a small mass due to oxide growth decay or film deposition at the surface of the acoustic resonator.Crystal oscillatorA crystal oscillator is an electronic oscillator circuit that uses the mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal of piezoelectric material to create an electrical signal with a precise frequency.[1][2][3] This frequency is often used to keep track of time,as in quartz wristwatches,to provide a stable clock signal for digital integrated.
