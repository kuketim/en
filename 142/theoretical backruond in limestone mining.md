## Modeling Rock Fracture Propagation and Water Inrush …
Water inrush in underground mines is a major safety threat for mining personnel,and it can also cause major damage to mining equipment and result in severe production losses.Water inrush can be attributed to the coalescence of rock fractures and the formation of water channel in rock mass due to the interaction of fractures,hydraulic flow,and stress field.Hence,predicting the fracturing.Primary Crushing2020 2 29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The term “primary crusher,” by definition,might embrace any type and size of crushing machine.The term implies that at least two stages of crushing are involved,but in many cases the machine which performs the function of initial crusher is the only crusher in the plant.The factors influencing the selection of a crusher for this service are much the same,regardless of how many.
