## Mine Tailings Pumping and Transportation
Mine tailings are the byproduct of large mining operations.These tailings require heavy duty pumps to transport them away from the mining area and into the designated discharge areas.Learn which pumps are best,and how this is accomplished.LEACHING OF FLOTATION TAILINGS4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;leaching process has no significant effect on degree of copper.Optimum leaching time is 4 h.Based on the results,shown in Figure 4,the optimal ratio of S:L for the copper leaching process from flotation tailings is 1:2.5.The highest degree of copper leaching of 56% was achieved in the following

Tailings management is not restricted towards finding the most technically suitable equipment or solution; it is about transformation and taking the mine life cycle to a new level.At Metso,we are ready to lead the dialogue and transformation towards dry tailings management and even look at addressing the decommissioning of legacy dams.Tailings4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Tailings are pollution causing blocks that are created when smelting ores at a Bloomery and a Blast Furnace.Stockpiles and other storage (including vehicles) containing Tailings will leak pollution into surrounding blocks.Only burying Tailings under a significant amount of material will stop them from polluting the surface ground.
