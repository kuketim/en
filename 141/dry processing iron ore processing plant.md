## Vale will invest 11 billion reals in dry mineral.
Dry mineral processing is related to the grade of iron in the mined ore.In Caracas,because of the high iron grade (more than 64%),the ore only needs to be crushed and screened,so it can be screened according to the size (particle size) of the ore.In Minas Gerais,iron exists in rocks known as &quot;iron quartzite&quot; with an average iron grade of 40%.Wet ore: a sticky issueHandling Wet and Sticky Ore (WSO) is a long standing issue which has left many mining companies shrugging their shoulders and questioning how to address …
