## What Is Granite?
First,granite is made of large mineral grains (its name is Latin for &quot;granum,&quot; or &quot;grain&quot;) that fit tightly together.It is phaneritic,meaning its individual grains are large enough to distinguish with the human eye.Second,granite always consists of the minerals quartz and feldspar,with or without a wide variety of other minerals (accessory minerals).GranitePotassium is a radioactive isotope of weak emission,and a constituent of alkali feldspar,which in turn is a common component of granitic rocks,more abundant in alkali feldspar granite and syenites.Some granites contain around 10 to 20 parts per million.
