## Conveyor Belt Manual
Conveyor belts generally are composed of three main components: 1.Carcass 2.Skims 3.Covers (carry cover and pulley cover) CARCASS The reinforcement usually found on the inside of a conveyor belt is normally referred to as the &quot;carcass.&quot; In aBelt Tension Calculator Belt ManagementAdditional tension must be added to the effective Belt Tension (Te) to prevent slippage on the drive pulley.This is called Ts,or commonly referred to as T2.TC = F 1 x L x CW F 1 =.035″ [Normal friction factor for average conditions (over 20 F) to move empty belt.] L = Belt length (ft.)CW = Weight of conveyor belt components.
