## Ore Dressing
The particle size is of particular importance in this process.If the particles are too large,unwanted accessory minerals cannot be separated from the ore.The ore concentrate obtained only has a low purity.Overgrinding,on the other hand,results in high milling costs and low throughput as well as an increased need for chemicals in flotation.Crusher Discharge T10 PSD Particle Size DistributionI'm trying simulating a two stage iron ore crushing circuit to produce a maximum of lump and all I know is that the top size of the shot rock is 600 mm and the Crushing Work Index is 9 kW h tonne.Let's say a very similar ore is giving a lump to fines split of 40:60.
