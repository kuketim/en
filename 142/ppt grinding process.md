various types of grinding process in our previous post,where we have discussed each grinding process in detail.We have also discussed basic principle of grinding in our previous post,where we have seen the basics of grinding process and various abrasives materials as well as we have also noted the various factors affecting the quality of object surface created by grinding process.Electrochemical grindingElectrochemical grinding is a process that removes electrically conductive material by grinding with a negatively charged abrasive grinding wheel,an electrolyte fluid,and a positively charged workpiece.[1] Materials removed from the workpiece stay in the electrolyte fluid.Electrochemical grinding is similar to electrochemical machining but.
