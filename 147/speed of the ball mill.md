For ball milling,there is an optimum speed where the centrifugal force at the top of the mill is just balanced by the force of gravity.This caused the balls to be lifted to the maximum height before they fall onto the balls below,thus imparting the most kinetic energy.In practice,the ball mill is run at just below this speed (70 80%).Ball MillingBall milling technique,using mechanical alloying and mechanical milling approaches were proposed to the word wide in the 8th decade of the last century for preparing a wide spectrum of powder materials and their alloys.In fact,ball milling process is not new and dates ba

## Ball Mills
The point where the mill becomes a centrifuge is called the &quot;Critical Speed&quot;,and ball mills usually operate at 65% to 75% of the critical speed.Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1 4 inch and finer,down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns.Page 1 Ball Milling TheoryOnce you know the ideal speed of rotation for your mill jars,you will need to design your mill around this critical parameter.With most ball mill designs,you have two areas of speed reduction to tweak: from the motor drive shaft to the drive pulley and

## Cement mill
Ball mills are normally operated at around 75% of critical speed,so a mill with diameter 5 metres will turn at around 14 rpm.The mill is usually divided into at least two chambers (although this depends upon feed input size mills including a roller press are mostly single chambered),allowing the use of different sizes of grinding media.Is the speed of planetary ball mill the faster,the better.Finding this reasonable range will allow the performance of the planetary ball mill to be fully utilized and material to be processed with less effort.When the planetary ball mill running at high speed,the faster the rotational speed is,the faster the temperature of the ball mill system rises.

## Ball Mills
For ball milling,there is an optimum speed where the centrifugal force at the top of the mill is just balanced by the force of gravity.This caused the balls to be lifted to the maximum height before they fall onto the balls below,thus imparting the most kinetic energy.In practice,the ball mill is run at just belo
