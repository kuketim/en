## Gear
A gear or cogwheel is a rotating machine part having cut teeth or,in the case of a cogwheel,inserted teeth (called cogs),which mesh with another toothed part to transmit torque.Geared devices can change the speed,torque,and direction of a power source.Gears almost always produce a change in torque,creating a mechanical advantage,through their gear ratio,and thus may bUnderstanding CNC Torque vs HorsepowerTraditionally,a larger diameter 1‚Äù end mill would require high torque and low speed (SFM RPM),while a 1 4‚Äù diameter end mill would require low torque and high speed (SFM RPM).Generally,different end mill diameters &amp; geometries have different requirements for both horsepower and torque.
