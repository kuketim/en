## Processing Gold Ore by Flotation
2020 2 7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;APPLICATION OF FLOTATION TO GOLD ORE.A flotation plant is being erected at the Falcon mine,Rhodesia,to treat ore containing gold and copper.With the exception of the Mt.Morgan,the Etheridge,and the Great Fitzroy mines,Queensland,I have not heard of the flotation process being used successfully to treat ore containing an appreciable amount of gold.Gold Flotation Gold Mining Process Gold Mining.2020 2 16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Process Introduction The flotation method is a widely used technique for the recovery of gold from gold containing copper ores,base metal ores,copper nickel ores,platinum group ores and many other ores where other processes are not applicable.

## Gold CIL process
Cyanidation carbon adsorption process is the most widely used in gold cyanide extraction process.The principle in brief is the carbon could adsorb liquid gold from cyanide solution.In 1970s,with the research and establishment of adsorption of carbon loaded with gold and the recovery of carbon discharge gold,make recycle the carbon and reduce the cost,and easy to process the gold.Gold extractionGold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing,resulting in direct recovery of.
