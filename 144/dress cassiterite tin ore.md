## Tin Ores Article about Tin Ores by The Free Dictionary
Native tin ore deposits,which form in aluminosilicate rocks,are found in three types of formation: pegmatite,cassiterite quartz,and cassiterite sulfide.Pegmatite formations are geologically associated with acid granites and are characterized by irregular aggregates or individual inclusions of large cassiterite crystals.What is Cassiterite?Cassiterite (tin oxide,SnO2) is the best known and principle tin ore.Tin (cassiterite) is currently classified as a conflict mineral along with tantalum (coltan),tungsten (wolramite) and gold.These 3T minerals,not including gold,are often found together in the same mineral deposits.

## Cassiterite
Cassiterite is a mineral composed of tin and oxygen (SnO 2).It is the most important ore of tin.Pure cassiterite is light colored mineral,but in real world it contains some iron,which makes the crystals often look almost opaque.The grains in sand are usually light to dark brown.9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Although flotation techniques for cassiterite have been developed in the 1970’s,about 85% of the world’s tin is still produced by gravity separation.Whenever gravity methods are chosen in preference to flotation,it is usually because relative costs favor the application.
