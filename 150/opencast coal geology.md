Coal is mined by both surface or ‘opencut’ (or opencast) and underground or ‘deep’ mining methods,depending on the local geology of the deposit.Underground mining currently accounts for about 60 per cent of world coal production but around 80 per cent of Australia’s coal is produced from opencut mines.Mainshill Opencast Coal SiteThe Scottish Coal Company Limited (Scottish Coal) wishes to apply for planning permission to extract coal by opencast methods,on land known as Mainshill lying to the east of Douglas,South Lanarkshire (Figure 1).The proposed development will result in the
