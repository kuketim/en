Mix ratio of M35 is 1 : 1.6 : 2.907 (Cement : Sand: Coarse Aggregates ).Now let’s see How did i derived this proportion The mix design for M35 Grade Of Concrete for pile foundations provided here is for reference purpose only.Actual site conditi.A Comparative Study of Concretes Containing Crushed.24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In addition,the fracture energy of crushed sand concrete was slightly higher than that of river sand concrete.Also,the fracture energy was not proportionally increased with an increase of concrete strength.The characteristic length of crushed limestone sand concrete was almost the same as that of river sand concrete or crushed granite sand.
