## Understanding Rolling Process in Long Product Rolling Mill.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;It is a fact that all mill rolls eventually deteriorate and the roll passes need to be changed to achieve size control and finished product surface quality.When the roll diameter reduces to less than the minimum diameter required by the mill stand after turning down,then the roll is to be discarded.Stand and roll guide set upParticle Size and Standard DeviationRoll corrugations (also described as roll cut or fluting) will vary depending on the material to be processed,initial and finished product sizes and the product quality (amount of fines) desired.Coarse grooving will produce a coarse finished product at high capacities while finer grooving produ
