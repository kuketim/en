## Mining Facts for Kids
The mining process is responsible for much of the energy we use and products we consume.Mining has been a vital part of American economy and the stages of the mining process have had little fluctuation.However,the process of mining for ore is intricate and requires meticulous work procedures to be efficient and effective.This is why we have.copper ore crusher mining process in peruCopper mining in the open pit or underground mine through all the copper sulfide and oxide,mining or blasting,and crushing started,crushing,copper ore into less than 25 cm in diameter and the particle size of the process,though small,coarse crusher,then

## The mining process
Copper concentrate is fed into the ISASMELT furnace,where it is heated to 1185 degrees Celsius.This process melts the concentrate into liquid,drawing out impurities and releasing sulfur dioxide gas,which is captured and piped to the Incitec Pivot Acid Plant adjacent to our smelter stack for conversion into sulphuric acid,used in crop fertilisers.Underground Mine DevelopmentThe planned underground expansions to existing mines,as well as major new underground operations being looked at,means that achieving faster and more efficient development underground is as much at the fore as it has ever been.In this month’s im mining.com ‘Spotlight Feature Article’,from the pages of the December 2011 issue of International Mining magazine,Editor Paul Moore looks.
