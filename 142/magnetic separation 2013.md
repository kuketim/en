## A magnetic separator for efficient microalgae harvesting
A magnetic separator,which consisted of permanent magnet drum,separation chamber and scraper blade,was manufactured for efficient microalgae harvesting.The harvesting efficiency of Chlorella ellipsoidea cells reached more than 95% within forty seconds in …Gd3+ nanoparticle enhanced multivalent biosensing that …In this work,we developed a multivalent magnetic biosensing strategy by integrating magnetic separation and magnetic relaxation switching (MRS) where Gd 3+ loaded magnetic nanoparticles acted as the probe.As a transition metal ion,Gd 3+ has multiple unpaired electrons in the d orbitals that can induce a strong fluctuating magnetic field and thus can reduce the transverse relaxation time (T 2.
