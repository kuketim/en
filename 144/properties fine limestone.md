## Limestone
Limestone is a very common sedimentary rock consisting of calcium carbonate (more than 50%).It is the most common non siliciclastic (sandstone and shale are common siliciclastic rocks) sedimentary rock.Limestones are rocks that are composed of mostly calcium carbonate (minerals calcite or aragonite).Carbonate rocks where the dominant carbonate is dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate) are.Geotechnical Properties of Geologic Materials27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp; Chemical: Rock such as limestone formed by chemical precipitation.
