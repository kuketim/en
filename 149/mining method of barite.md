## Industrial test study on flotation of barite from tailings of.
The 600 t d industrial flotation test on recovering the lead zinc tailings of Panlong Lead zinc Mine in Guangxi is carried out.The properties of lead zinc tailings in situ are analyzed,and the process flow of desliming,desulfurization and barite flotation of lead and zinc.Iron Ore Mining Techniques,Metal Extraction,Types …MINING AND PROCESSING: Iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two categories namely 1) manual mining which is employed in small mines and 2) mechanized mining is suitable for large iron ore mines.Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores and small mines.Mining of reef ore is also being done manually on a small scale.
