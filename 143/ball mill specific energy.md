A particle size reduction model has been developed as the first component of an upgraded ball mill model.The model is based on a specific energy size reduction function,which calculates the particle breakage index,t 10,according to the size specific energy,and then calculates the full product size distribution using the t t n relationships and the mass size balance approach.What exactly is 'Work Index' and how can I make. Metcom Expertise'Work Index' is to measuring energy in size reduction what the 'meter' is to measuring.For any circuit,whether a crushing circuit,a rod mill,or a closed ball mill.
