## Location Dependent Prediction of Dynamic Stability …
The stability limit may change with the cutter’s location due to effect of curvature during the milling of a complex surface.The method for calculating the actual radial cutting depth is presented by accounting for the effects of curvature on the actual cutting parameters.The computed radial cutting depth is in turn used to determine the entrance exit angles.milling machine for firearm work? under $1000? The …&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Great machine for what I want,but not under $1,000.BTW,the DRO,power feed and a Kurt vice cost more than the machine (about $1,500 new when I bought it) and I have about twice that in tooling,so I have about $5 to $6k in my milling setup.Tom C
