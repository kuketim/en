## Ore Hardness Testing SAG Mill Tonnage Estimation Method
For design purposes,you need an estimation or prediction of your SAG Mill’s tonnage; well,there are 3 ways to generate good rock “ore” hardness testing data for SAG and ball mill circuit grindability from half drill core.We can abbreviate the discussion by saying.Limestone: Rock Uses,Formation,Composition,PicturesComposition of Limestone Limestone is by definition a rock that contains at least 50% calcium carbonate in the form of calcite by weight.All limestones contain at least a few percent other materials.These can be small particles of quartz,feldspar,clay minerals,pyrite,siderite,and other minerals.siderite,and other minerals.

## Hard water
Hard water is water that has high mineral content (in contrast with &quot;soft water&quot;).Hard water is formed when water percolates through deposits of limestone,chalk or gypsum[1] which are largely made up of calcium and magnesium carbonates,bicarbonates and sulfates.Hard drinking water may have moderate health benefits,but can pose critical.Limestone Crusher HardnessLimestone Crushing Hardness schaden24 The limestone is a kind of medium hardness material,which is easily crushed.The Platts hardness is in 5,the density is in 1.1.5t m3.The common crushing equipment for the limestone are jaw crusher,impact
