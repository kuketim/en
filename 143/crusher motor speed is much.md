## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.Crush Cans Effortlessly with an Arduino Powered Arm …Use an Arduino and an H bridge motor circuit to build an automatic crusher for soda cans.sudden changes in speed or direction can cause big problems.The resultant large currents may damage the H bridge,and there’s also the mechanical shock to the bearings of the motor.7 Responses to Crush Cans Effortlessly with an Arduino Powered.

Speed The speed of an AC motor depends on two things: the number of poles of the sta tor winding and the main frequency.At 50 Hz,a motor will run at a speed related to a constant of 6000 divided by the number of poles and for a 60 Hz motor the constant is 7200.To calculate the speed of a motor,the following formula can be used: n = 2 x f x 60 pWhat is the difference between the speed and the torque …Speed is the rate at which the engine spins ( thats why the unit RPM rotations per minute ) Torque is how much twisting force the engine generates at its shaft for a particular speed of rotation ( Torque = Force x Perpendicular distance Unit.
