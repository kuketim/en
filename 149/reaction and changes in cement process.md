The concrete curing process involves a reaction between Portland cement and water helping on releasing heat from the concrete at a desired and controlled rate.2.3.4 Soil Stabilization with Traditional and Non.2.3.4 Soil Stabilization with Traditional and Non Traditional Stabilizers The artificial traditional admixtures in order of their usage are: • Portland Cement (and Cement Fly Ash) • Lime (and Lime Fly Ash) • Fly Ash • Fly Ash with Cement or Lime • Bitumen and Tar • Cement Kiln Dust (CKD) In recent years an increasing number of non traditional additives have been developed for soil.
