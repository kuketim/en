More importantly though is the very real problem of sulphurs from the coals mixing with the moisture from the wood to create a highly acidic deposit which can and does corrode stainless steel liners.It’s worth bearing in mind that even well seasoned wood gives off some moisture (about 20% of its mass) and that,when mixed with the sulphurs from coal,can create the liner eating deposit.Hydrogen Fuel Gets a Boost with Stainless Steel TechnologyThe science of producing hydrogen to power fuel cells in microbial electrolysis processes has just received a boost with some research at Pennsylvania State University that uses stainless steel.

## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish black sedimentary rock,formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements; chiefly hydrogen,sulfur,oxygen,and nitrogen.[1] Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.[2]EVRAZ ZSMK launches pulverised coal injection unit.EVRAZ ZSMK has launched a pulverised coal injection unit for two of its blast furnaces.The unit's productive capacity amounts to 160 tons of pulverised coal fuel per hour,or about 1.3 million tons annually.Investment for this project has exceeded EUR 0.15B.
