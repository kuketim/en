The concrete mix design available on this site are for reference purpose only.Actual site conditions vary and thus this should be adjusted as per the location and other factors.These are just to show you how to calculate and we are thankful to all the members who have emailed us these mix designs so that these could be shared with civil.Calculating the quantity of cement,sand,& aggregates in,25 06 2021&#0183;&#32;Let us consider the w c ratio for M10 grade concrete as 05 ie wt of cement wt of water = 05 So,the weight of water = 05 × wt of cement =05 × 22177 kgs = 11089 kgs = 11089 liters ( 1kg= 1 liter) Note: This w c ratio holds good if you use plasticizers Practically for good workability,the water we add for the concrete is 133.
