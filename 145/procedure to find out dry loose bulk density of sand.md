## What is the density of sand?
It depends on several factors.First,what's the density of the minerals that make up the sand in question.Keep in mind that Sand is a name refering to how big the grains are and not what they are made of.Though most sand is made either of Quar.Exp 5 Bulk DensityFrom the experiment performed we came to know that the bulk density of a material in compacted form is greater than the bulk density of a material in loose form.The percentage increase in the bulk density of Lawrence pure sand is 8.33 and the percentage increase in the bulk density of Sargodha crush is 12.5.

Further,aggregates in hauling units and stockpiles usually contain absorbed and surface moisture (the latter affecting bulking),while this test method determines the bulk density on a dry basis.4.3 A procedure is included for computing the percentage of voids between the aggregate particles based on the bulk density determined by this test method.Saturated SandThe moist sand above the groundwater table has a moisture content (w) of 29% and a dry unit weight (γ d) equal to 16.0 kN m 3.Below the groundwater table the sand has a saturated unit weight of 20.0 kN m 3.Laboratory test results on a sample of the clay from the.
