## Factors Affecting Ball Mill Grinding Efficiency
The following are factors that have been investigated and applied in conventional ball milling in order to maximize grinding efficiency: a) Mill Geometry and Speed Bond (1954) observed grinding efficiency to be a function of ball mill diameter,and established empirical relationships for recommended media size and mill speed that take this factor into account.Mill (grinding)A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.
