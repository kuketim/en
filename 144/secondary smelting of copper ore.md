## Copper Scrap
Recycling of copper is based on a large variety of raw materials,ranging from low grade copper scrap containing only a few percent Cu to very high grade copper as well as pure copper close to 100% Cu (Table 7.1).Thus there are several options for recycling processes,within both primary plants and secondary plants treating only scrap material.ProcessesProcesses.Copper is found in natural ore deposits around the world.This page explains the production route taken from extraction of ore containing rock to a final product that is the highest purity commercial metal in existence and used in a wide variety of applications essential to modern living.

## 12.3 Primary Copper Smelting
10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;12.3 Primary Copper Smelting 12.3.1 General1 Copper ore is produced in 13 states.In 1989,Arizona produced 60 percent of the total U.S.ore.Fourteen domestic mines accounted for more than 95 percent of the 1.45 megagrams (Mg) (1.6 millon tons) of ore produced in 1991.Copper is produced in the U.S.primarily by pyrometallurgical smelting.Copper Ore Processing MethodsThe four major steps in the production of marketable copper are mining,concentrating,smelting,and refining.In a few instances,however,leaching takes the place of concentrating,smelting,and refining.At present,although considerable leaching and direct smelting ores are produced,the bulk of the copper ore mined is concentrated.The milling of copper ores as practiced in the larger.
