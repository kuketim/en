## Study on the formation of direct reduced iron by using
To investigate the possibility of using biomass reductants instead of fossil fuels in the formation of direct reduced iron (DRI) in rotary hearth furnace (RHF),three kinds of cheap biomass such as bamboo char,straw fiber and charcoal were selected as reductants to compare with anthracite and graphite.kiln &amp furnace hightechdevelopment201858&ensp&#0183&enspA rotary hearth furnace is mainly used in direct reduced iron indistry,iron ore powder is reduced and molten into pig iron in the condition of reducing atmosphere.Its working temperature is up to 1520 ℃.A rotary heath furnace technology can also be used in the smelting of ferronickel,ferrochrome and ferromanganese and other ferroalloy.
