The melting point of sand,which consists mainly of silicon dioxide or silica,is approximately 2930 degrees Fahrenheit.Its boiling point is 4046 F.Silicon dioxide is a hard substance,not soluble in water and a poor conductor of electricity.The sand on beaches is made up of silicon dioxide or silica.Sunstate Sands Silica Sand Supplier Queensland Australia.The Sunstate Sands Bundaberg Silica Sand Mine product at Coonarr,is unusual in that the mine can deliver material from below 250 microns up to 5mm.The company has graded the resource into three major products,which in fact occur in naturally graded layers commencing with superfine at the top and finishing with coarse on the bottom.

Does anybody know what formula would make a good gold smelting flux? I am planning on buying a kiln in the near future and the only formula for flux I have found is: 30 grams of ground sample + 30 grams soda (Na2CO3) + 30 grams lead oxide (PbO) + 2 grams flour + 10 grams silica sand.

## Silica (Crystalline)
Applications for silica differ depending on the particle size,which is divided into three general size categories: lump silica,0.3 15 cm; sand,75 μm 3 mm; and flour,&lt; 75 μm.Lump silica is used as flux for smelting operations,in silicon and ferrosilicon alloys,and for silica brick.This size fraction is not of concern for health.Silica22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Silica (silicon dioxide,SiO 2) occurs as the mineral quartz,a major constituent in many igneous and sedimentary rocks,and the most common detrital mineral in sandstone.As a commodity,the term silica is applied to quartz in all its forms — as vein or reef quartz,quartz pebbles,sandstone,quartzite,or as unconsolidated sand.
