## Mineral processing
Thickening.In the process of thickening (also called sedimentation),the solids in a suspension settle under the influence of gravity in a tank and form a thick pulp.This pulp,and the clear liquid at the top of the tank,can be removed continuously or intermittently.thickening process mineralIn the current ore dressing process,most mineral processing plant adopt wet separation process,so the concentrate has very high water content,which can't be smelted directly.As the first step of dewatering operation,thickening operation occupies 9% influences on the whole beneficiation process,and 35% effects on the whole dewatering.

## Iron ore tailings dry stacking in Pau Branco mine,…
Vallourec's beneficiation plant produces concentrated iron ore lumps and fines in Pau Branco mine.Tailings are composed of both fines (&gt;45 μm) and ultra fines (&lt;45 μm).Ultra fines are generated from the de sliming cycloning of the magnetic concentration process,and fines are the rejects of this process.Solid Liquid Separation ThickeningThe process of grinding and classification involves the use of large quantities of water.In the gold industry for instance,the rule of thumb is a tonne of water for a tonne of ore.This bulk of water has to be separated or reduced for down stream treatment for recovery of the mineral in the ore.
