## Moisture Correction for Coal Analysis
Moisture in coal varies from the point where it is received to the point where it enters the boiler.The variation in the moisture affects the reported heating value and analysis.The laboratory analysis is required to be corrected to the actual moisture content in the field.Methods for applying these corrections are explained here.Proximate and Ultimate Analysis of Power Plant Coal The proximate analysis determines only the Fix carbon,Volatile matter.The ultimate analysis is useful in determining required air for combustion for power plants coal.coal analysis gcv adb basis formulaCoal Nar Gcv Adb,convert arb to gar coal calorific value calculate ncv and gcv of coal,formula to calculate ar coal gcv,Glossary ADBAir Dried Basis In coal sample analysis,ADB neglects the presence of moistures other than inherent moisture while DB (dry basis) leaves out all moistures,including surface moisture,inherent
