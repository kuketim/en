## What Metals Are Magnetic? Reference.com
Nickel,iron and cobalt are magnetic metals.Most other metals,including gold,copper,silver and magnesium,are generally not magnetic,although some of these metals might become slightly magnetic if placed in a magnetic field.Magnets are created by heating a suitable metal enough to exceed the material’s Curie temperature.What is the hardest non metal?This is hardest non metal as well as hardest natural substance on the earth.Its DIAMOND.The allotrope of Carbon.Before some years when I heard the word ‘carbon’ something like this came into my mind.But when I came to know that Diamond is a fo.

## Everything You Need to Identify Rocks
In simple terms,hard rock scratches glass and steel,usually signifying the minerals quartz or feldspar,which has a Mohs hardness of 6 or higher.Soft rock does not scratch steel but will scratch fingernails (Mohs scale of 3 to 5.5),while very soft rock won't even scratch fingernails (Mohs scale of 1 to 2).Why Is This Rock Worth $400,000?Weight: Because of their unusual density,meteorites can be up to 3.5 times heavier than Earth rocks of similar size.For more info,consult Field Guide to Meteors and Meteorites by O.Richard.
