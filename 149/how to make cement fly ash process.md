## What Is Fly Ash Cement? (with pictures)
16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Fly ash,which is largely made up of silicon dioxide and calcium oxide,can be used as a substitute for Portland cement,or as a supplement to it.The materials which make up fly ash are pozzolanic,meaning that they can be used to bind — or cement — materials together.Pozzolanic materials generally add durability and strength to concrete.The Disadvantages of Fly Ash in Concrete HunkerFly ash is a byproduct from coal fired power plants that is frequently used as an admixture in concrete to replace a portion of the Portland cement.Using fly ash in concrete is environmentally beneficial because it reduces the Portland cement (a major contributor of CO2) required in concrete.

## How Fly Ash Concrete Works HowStuffWorks
To deal with both of those problems,the construction industry had the clever idea to start formulating concrete out of fly ash,substituting fly ash for Portland cement (the primary ingredient in most concrete).Surprisingly,fly ash has several characteristics that make it a perfect ingredient for concrete: It has great strength and durability (although we're still waiting to see how it.Using Fly Ash in ConcreteFly ash’s behavior is largely dependent upon the composition of the coal from which the fly ash was created.According to the Portland Cement Association,fly ash can have glass contents ranging from about 50% to 90%,depending on the coal that was used and the manufacturing process.
