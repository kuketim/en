## Pure Aluminum
Pure aluminium powder and pure copper powder can be used to produce an Al Al 2 Cu composite via FSP.Cu reacts completely with Al and forms Al 2 Cu during FSP.In addition,copper oxides (CuO and Cu 2 O),which result from oxidation during sintering in air,disappeared after FSP,which might be a result of the reaction between Al and copper oxides to form Al 2 O 3 and Al 2 Cu (Figure 9.9.Is Aluminum Safe to Use? Wellness Mama3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Aluminum powder is used as a colorant in many cosmetics but mainly in nail polish,eye shadow,eye liner,and lip gloss.It may be listed in the ingredients as: Aluminum,aluminum flake,LB Pigment 5,Pigment Metal 1,A 00,A 95,A 995,A 999,AA 1099,or AA 1199.

## Nanopowders
The oxide layers may have different thickness and chemical compositions,depending on the powder production and passivation methods [72,73].For aluminum,according to the works [74,75],this thickness is about 8 10 nm on the surface of the 50 1000 nm particles (Fig.9.28).).Safety and regulatory overview for powder coatingHaving said all that,powder coating application and recovery is still a production process,and like anything in a manufacturing facility,safety should always be a top concern.Working with powder may look benign,but it still involves all the elements for potential combustion: the fuel in the form of the powder to air mixture from the application gun,
