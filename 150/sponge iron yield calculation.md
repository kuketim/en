## Powder metallurgy Wikipedia
Powder metallurgy (PM) is a term covering a wide range of ways in which materials or components are made from metal powdersPM processes can avoid,or greatly reduce,the need to use metal removal processes,thereby drastically reducing yield losses in manufacture and often resulting in lower costsIndian Sponge Iron Industry Steelworldyield • Carbon content During continuous feeding,an active carbon oxygen boil is necessary to shield the arcs It has been observed that to achieve the aforesaid,sponge iron should possess a minimum of 060% carbon The ideal oxygen content in sponge iron (as FeO) can be related with the rating of furnace capacity to power input for.
