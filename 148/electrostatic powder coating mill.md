## Electrostatic coating
Electrostatic coating is a manufacturing process that employs charged particles to more efficiently paint a workpiece.Paint,in the form of either powdered particles or atomized liquid,is initially projected towards a conductive workpiece using normal spraying methods,and is then accelerated toward the work piece by a powerful electrostatic charge.Powder Coating Vs PaintThere are many advantages to powder coating our products over applying regular wet paint.I’ll start with explaining the process of powder coating and then outline the main advantages.Powder Coating is the application of organic powder by electrostatic attraction to metal.Once cured by heat the finish is a smooth,hard skin.
