## Silica sand and glass industry
a) Silica sand The discolouring impurities iron and chromium occur within the non quartz mineral fraction of the sands.Iron can occur as haematite,giving the sand a red colour,or as oxy hydroxidcs (giving a yellow or brown colour) as well as in silicate minerals.Chromium occurs as the heavy mineral chromite (FeCr2O4),which is stable during.Evaluation for the Beneficiability of White Silica Sands.A representative feed sample of White Silica Sand was wet sieved in order to recover the desired fractions for glass making.BIS specification shows that ( 600,+300) μm] fraction [A] should not be more than 50% and ( 300,+125) μm fraction [B] should be 50% minimum.The mass percentage of A and B is found to be 29.9 and 70.1% (ratio =1:3.34) which satisfies the size specifications for.
