## Nokeng fluorspar mine officially opened
The mine’s concentrator will produce around 180 000 t of acid grade fluorspar (97 % pure fluorspar) and 30 000 t of metallurgical grade fluorspar annually from run of mine fluorspar ore production of 630 000 t.Open pit mining and modern plant efficiency are expected to put Nokeng in the bottom cost quartile internationally.Fluorspar Statistics and Information2020 2 28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Fluorspar is used directly or indirectly to manufacture products such as aluminum,gasoline,insulating foams,refrigerants,steel,and uranium fuel.Byproduct fluorosilicic acid production from some phosphoric acid producers supplements fluorspar as a domestic source of fluorine,but is not included in fluorspar production or consumption calculations.
