## Oil and gas: Water treatment in oil and gas production …
There are many reasons why water treatment is a vital and integral part of both oil and gas production operations.Inadequate design of the water treatment system,or forgetting to optimise the system's operation,could lead to a shutdown of the hydrocarbonWater Treatment PlantOne of the first hybrid membrane commercial plants to treat produced water (capacity 7200 m 3 d and TDS = 7000 mg L) was commissioned for an oilfield in San Luis Obispo County,California in 2013.The treatment process OPUS &#174; II technology consists of ceramic membrane pretreatment followed by IX and a two pass RO system [29].

## Improving The Environmental Impact of Bottled Water …
Reducing water consumption As water grows scarce,reducing water consumption is a key factor in working towards a sustainable planet.As part of Nestl&#233; Waters’ ongoing efforts to improve the water efficiency of its operations,we have implemented a number of conservation techniques and initiatives in our factories over the years,including reverse osmosis to better filter and reuse.The Importance Of Water TreatmentThe goal of all water treatment process is to remove existing contaminants in the water,or reduce the concentration of such contaminants so the water becomes fit for its desired end use.One such use is returning water that has been used back into the natural environment without adverse ecological impact.
