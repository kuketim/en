## Designing a Conveyor System
The Problem with Designing a Conveyor System.The designer of belt conveyors is often faced with problems of determining the proper belt speeds,belt widths,number of plies in the belt,and idler spacing for conveyors employed in various parts of a mill.Belt FeedersBelt feeders are commonly used when material that is either stockpiled or loaded (at an uncontrolled rate) in a bin or hopper needs to be introduced into the system at a controlled feed rate.Able to handle a variety of materials,belt feeders are reliable and useful in an endle

## Study on the Method for Collecting Vibration Signals …
At present the method for measuring the fill level which used the vibration signal of mill shell shows its advantage compared with other methods.However,this method is developed late,and the technique for collecting the vibration signal from mill shell is immature.In this paper,a novel method for collecting the vibration data from mill shell is proposed.The Pelleting Process9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;feed lumps and gives a dressed feed into the bin above the pellet mill.A pellet mill is not designed to pellet these materials,let alone the animal stomach to digest them.The pelleting process starts with a bin (Figure 1,Item 1) in which the mixture of mash is stored.From there,the mash will flow by gravity into the pellet mill (Figure 1.

## Belt Feeders
Belt feeders are commonly used when material that is either stockpiled or loaded (at an uncontrolled rate) in a bin or hopper needs to be introduced into the system at a controlled feed rate.Able to handle a variety of materials,belt feeders are reliable and useful in an endless amount of applications.How to Size a ThickenerKnowing how to size a thickener and determine the capacity required to handle a pre determined tonnage of a certain pulp,by overflowing a clear solution and obtaining the desired pulp density of thickener discharge,depends upon the settling rate of that particular pulp.The settling rate of any pulp is easily determined by simple laboratory tests such as outlined below: Laboratory Test.
