## Ball Milling
Ball milling is suggested as a novel method for enhancing filler dispersion in different matrices that is environmentally and economically sustainable [85].It is a solid state mixing of powders,usually performed with ball mills,which enables intimate mixing of the constituents through repetitive plastic deformation.Cement millA cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage) is the equipment used to grind the hard,nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement.Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.
