## Steelmaking by Induction Furnace ispatguru
The first steel made in an induction furnace in United States was in 1907 in a Colby furnace near Philadelphia First 3 phase furnace was built in Germany in 1906 by Rochling Rodenhauser In India the use of induction furnaces started in mid sixti Imported medium frequency induction furnaces were used from mid seventiGold and Silver Refining Mineral Processing &,In addition,water not only wastes energy but it may cause small explosions in the furnace,preventing efficient separation of the precious metal from the slag The precipitate is therefore delivered to a rotary dryer via a screw feeder,where it is first dried,then mixed with fluxes,discharged into another screw feeder,and fed to the.
