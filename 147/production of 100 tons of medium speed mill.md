## Technical and Economic Analysis of the Shredding of MSW.
WTE electrical production of 650 kWh per metric ton of MSW processed,the required 3 11 kWh ton for LSHT devices is less than 2% and should be more than accounted for by improved combustion efficiency in the WTE plant.The addition of a shredding system in a medium sized WTE plant will increase the O&amp;M from current costs by roughly 10%,Feed Mills Engineering,High Quality Feed Milling Machines.Muyang offer complete feed mill construction solutions with advanced technology,efficient equipment,professional installation,complete support and quality service.The daily output of various feed mills Muyang undertook is 100 1,000 tons.
