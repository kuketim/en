## Estimation of Grinding Cycle Time Taking into Account.
In the grinding process,due to the elastic deformations of grinding machine and grinding wheel,the ground depth of cut is smaller than the applied depth of cut.Consequently,the ground depth of cut has to be controlled in spark out grinding process.However,the cycle time in spark out grinding process is not easy to be estimated.From such a viewpoint,in this study,using specific.
