## Gypsum and its role in trapping ammonia gas
Gypsum has more sulfate available so it can trap more ammonium than superphosphate.The more product blended in the soil,the more ammonia was trapped.The key is to predict the amount of nitrogen per ton of material that will volatilize and then apply enough gypsum to capture that ammonia into a stable ammonium sulfate form.Ammonium Sulfate6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The nice thing about the ammonium sulfate is that the nitrogen in it is a little bit slower releasing so it lasts throughout the growing season better than the nitrate forms of nitrogen.We also find that ammonium sulfate is very helpful for plants that are producing any kind of oil,like soybeans that produce soybean oil.
