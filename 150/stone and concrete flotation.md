## Differences in Formed Surface Finishes Concrete.
Q.: What are the differences in appearance and cost for smooth rubbed,grout cleaned,and cork float finishes for formed concrete surfaces? A.: Cleveland concrete contractor Ron Simonetti says a smooth rubbed finish (done with an abrasive stone) should look the same as a grout cleaned (sacked) finish.However,stone rubbing has to be done soon after the forms are removed within a day or two.The Advantages of VibroflotationA cylindrical compaction zone is formed around the probe,and the achieved degree of compaction is indicated by an increase in oil pressure.The area around the probe is backfilled with granular material that will auto consolidate,as the probe is begin brought up.The material used to backfill should be free of silt,gravel or crushed stone.
