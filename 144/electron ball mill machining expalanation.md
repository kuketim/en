## Ball Mill: Operating principles,components,Uses.
A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis.The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 50%Optimization of mill performance by usingcharge motion.It is well known that ball milling efficiency varies during the lifetime of the shell liner.For instance,the mill performance could become worse or better by putting in a new shell liner.Data from pilot plant test work illustrates the influence of the shell lifting effect on the grind for a primary grinding duty.

## Ball Mill: Operating principles,components,Uses.
A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis.The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 50% of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.Ball MillsThe ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.
