## What is hydraulic fracturing?
2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Hydraulic fracturing,informally referred to as “fracking,” is an oil and gas well development process that typically involves injecting water,sand,and chemicals under high pressure into a bedrock formation via the well.This process is intended to create new fractures in the rock as well as increase the size,extent,and connectivity of existing fractures.The left s opposition to mining threatens its green dreamnbsp 0183 32 The mining of critical minerals is not without environmental risks but if environmentalists want to continue to promote green energy solutions they must recognize that domestic mineral resources

## Fracking
A mining process popularly known as fracking is one way of extracting vast amounts of fuel which would have formerly been inaccessible.Predictably however,though it may seem like a golden egg to feed our energy needs,it does have its negative side.Hydraulic Fracturing: The Process FracFocus Chemical.2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Contrary to many media reports,hydraulic fracturing is not a “drilling process.” Hydraulic fracturing is used after the drilled hole is completed.Put simply,hydraulic fracturing is the use of fluid and material to create or restore small fractures in a formation in order to stimulate production from new and existing oil and gas wells.
