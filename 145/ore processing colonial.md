Silver mining Wikipedia.Silver mining is the resource extraction of silver by mining.Silver is found in a native form very rarely as nuggets,but more usually combined with sulfur,arsenic,antimony,or chlorine and in various ores such as argentite (Ag 2 S),chlorargyrite (&quot;horn silver,&quot; AgCl),and galena (a lead ore often containing significant amounts of silver).Mining History in the United States Legends of AmericaMining History in the United States,written by Albert S.Bolles 1879,from the book Industrial History of the United States,Volume IV.Among the most serviceable inventions in practical mining and metallurgy in the late 19th century were the California stamp mill for crushing quartz,the mercury amalgamation process for gold,the pan process for silver,the hydraulic process of gold mining.

## Iron Forge in Colonial America by Harry Schenawolf.
The iron ore was to be smelted in America and shipped to Great Brittan.The Iron Act of 1750,spurred protests from colonial activists,was written to encourage the American manufacture of cast or pig iron and restrict the production of plate,sheet,and nail rods.In England,the iron was refined and manufactured into household products,wagon.History of the iron and steel industry in the United StatesThe US iron and steel industry has paralleled the industry in other countries in technological developments.In the 1800s,the US switched from charcoal to coke in ore smelting,adopted the Bessemer process,and saw the rise of very large integrated steel mills.In the 20th century,the US industry successively adopted the open hearth furnace.

Iron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron containing ores.﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore,leaving behind a soft,malleable iron metal.Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present day Iraq) between 27 BCE.SMELTING SILVER5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;All silver ores need to be fluxed for smelting.6 In Pliny's day,when almost all the ore smelted was high grade,the addition of lead or lead ore (galena,PbS) was sufficient for fluxing (book XXXIII,sec.XXXI).By the time that Biringuccio and Agricola are writing in the 16th century,the art of fluxing has advanced in complexity but not in.
