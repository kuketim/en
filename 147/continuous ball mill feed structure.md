## Ball Mill Feeders
The entire mill feed enters the drum via a chute or spout and an internal spiral carries the feed into the trunnion liner.The drum feeder may be used in lieu of a spout feeder when headroom limits direct spouting.The drum also provides a convenient method of adding grinding balls to a ball mill.The drum is generally lined with Manganese Steel.Continuous ball mill&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;For ball milling you need the Bond Ball Mill Work Index.Units are kWh t.Knowing the Bond Work Index and the feed and product sizes you can calculate the power input required.If you post more detail about the application and ore,we might be able to predict performance using values from similar ore types.Cheers,Nigel
