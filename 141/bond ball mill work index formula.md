## Bond Work Index Procedure and Method
2020 2 24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This Grindability Test or Bond Ball Mill Work Index Procedure is used to determine the Bond Work Index of minus six mesh or finer feed ore samples.These equation application methods are used to process &lt;1 2″ ore samples in a Ball Mill using a standard ball charge.Below describes in general terms the Bond Work Index Procedure used by a Professional Metallurgical Testing Laboratory.If you.Characteristics of Mae Moh lignite: Hardgrove grindability.2014 12 3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;test using ball race test mill was performed.Knowing the Hardgrove indices,the Bond work indices of some samples were estimated using the Aplan’s formula.The approximate work indices were determined by running a batch dry grinding test using a laboratory ball mill.Finally,the work indices obtained from both methods were compared.
