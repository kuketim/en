## Grinding Circuit
The SAG mill was designed to treat 2,065 t h −1 of ore at a ball charge of 8% volume,total filling of 25% volume,and an operating mill speed of 74% of critical.The mill is fitted with 80 mm grates with total grate open area of 7.66 m 2 (Hart et al.2001).A 4.5 m diameter by 5.2 m long trommel screens the discharge product at a cut size.4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Designed for discharge efficiency The role of the grate is to allow the discharge of the material ground in the mill via the slots.With our range of alloys and design experience we can offer the longest possible lifetime with the optimal grinding efficiency.The design of the grates will depend on: Drilling pattern Mill speed (rpm) Maximum grinding media diameter (mm) Grinding media filling.grate area grate area .grate area：…，grate area、、。,&quot;grate&quot; vt.1.，。2.；。 3.，.Wear of the grate hole edges or in the plate thickness results in an increase of the open area due to the tapered hole cross section,which can result in oversize product exiting the mill.Conversely,some grate castings feature peening of the edges during mill operation,thereby decreasing open area,and therefore preventing the desireed top.

Corrected for differences in SAG mill feed size,which has a direct influence on pebble rates from the SAG mill (Figure 5) Grate Aperture and Open Area In order to investigate the cause of lower pebble extraction rates a number of plant trials were undertaken Grate aperture size and open area of first half and then all of the outer grates was.The flow capacity (grinding capacity) of these mills is strongly influenced by the discharge grate design open area and position of apertures,as well as the performance of the pulp lifters.As mill sizes have progressively increased and closed circuiting has become more popular the importance of grate and pulp lifter design has grown.Round1818311841 McNICHOLS&#174; stocks Perforated Metal,Round Hole,Stainless Steel Type 304,18 Gauge,Mill Finish,1 8&quot; Holes on 3 16&quot; Centers,Staggered Pattern,40% Open Area… 21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;grate discharge ball mills.how does a grate discharge mill work how does a conical ball mill crusher works how is the capacity of a ball mill determined how to start an iron ore mine how to run wet process ball mill how is magnetite used in steel how does a grate discharge mill work

Slurry discharge capacity of autogenous and semi autogenous mills and the effect of grate design.A laboratory based study of tumbling mills has been undertaken in which the mill speed,grate open area and the position of the apertures were systematically varied and their effect on the relationship between water flowrate and hold up measured.13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;However,the curved design necessitates redrilling of the mill head and also requires curved grates,which can be quite complicated compared to a simple radial design.The best way to eliminate material problems is to use a grate,peripheral discharge trunnion supported mill or use a grate,open ended discharge shell supported mill.AUTOMATED CONDITION MONITORING OF MILL BALL …30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Accurate SAG alld AG mill product size control is depelldelll 011 appropriate Grate Opel Area dimensions.Wear of the bTl'ate hole edges ur in the plate thickness results in W I increase ufthe open area due to the tapered hole cross sectiOll,which call result ill oversize product exiting the mill.Different combinations of SAG mill ball charge and grate open area were tested until 2006.A higher load level was achieved after several changes in the grate design that prevented both liner and grate breakage.Upon resolution of issues related to the mill grate design,the project achieved the target throughput of 41 kt d.Phoenix
