## Difference between gold smelting equipment &amp; gold …
Gold melting and smelting are metallurgical procedures you can use to concentrate and recover gold.However,most people tend to confuse the two.So,let’s begin by defining each process.Melting is the process of changing gold from solid to liquid state.TheseGold Smelting & Refining ProcessDuring the smelting process,any residual mercury contained in the concentrate will be eliminated in the first moments An exhaust hood must be placed over the furnace to extract mercury and other fumes released during the heating process

## Mercury Usage in Gold Mining and Why It Is a Problem
Why is mercury used in gold mining and why is it a problem,which includes environmental risks,and health risks for miners,Any of the four stages of the small scale gold production process,namely amalgamation,separation of amalgamation,removal of excess mercury,and burning of the remaining amalgam,release mercury,Extracting gold using borax? Can someone explain?&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;I agree with the author of teaching these miners of how to process without use of the mercury.Smelting is an ancient form of gold recovery and refining.It will not get the gold pure.The pictures prove the gold is impure.There is nothing new about it.
