## Concrete
Concrete is strong in compression,as the aggregate efficiently carries the compression load.However,it is weak in tension as the cement holding the aggregate in place can crack,allowing the structure to fail.Reinforced concrete adds either steel reinforcing bars,steel fibers,aramid fibers,carbon fibers,glass fibers,or plastic fibers to carry tensile loads.C30 Concrete DIYnot Forums&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Hi all,I have had a cellar support designed by an engineer,and it specifies,amongst other things,&quot;C30&quot; concrete (which defines its resistance to crushing,I think).I need about 0.6m3 of if,about 0.15m3 at a time (days or weeks in between),so it's just not worth
