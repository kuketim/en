Now the mill steel ball on the market can be divided into two types according to the manufacturing process technology: Casting and forging.But the wear degrees are not the same.Due to crushing,ball need good wear resistance and toughness,which usually made of alloy steel,high manganese steel,cast iron and other materials and with forged or casted once forming method.BLASTING TECHNICAL INFORMATIONApprox.Sq.Ft.Cleaning Per Hour Loose Mill Scale 840 Sq.Ft.Tight Mill Scale 835 Sq.Ft.at 90 PSI Pitted Paint 830 Sq.Ft.Layered Paint 825 Sq.Ft.For more information on blast speciﬁcations contact SSPC.org B.MECHANICAL WHEEL BLASTING Wheel blast system utilizes a high.

## Tech Tip #32
When chatter occurs,it can be self sustaining until the problem is corrected.Chatter causes poor finish on the part,and will damage and significantly reduce the life of end mills.Carbide end mills are particularly susceptible to damage.Typical methods to reduce chatter include reducing cutting forces by: ReduCooling method of ball mill main bearing3.Circulating cooling water system.This method requires that there must be a casting hole in the ball mill spherical bearing bush,so that water can flow through the casting hole (serpentine pipe) and cool the ball mill main bearing.
