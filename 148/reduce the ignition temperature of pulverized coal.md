## Coal for Pulverized Coal Injection in Blast Furnace.
Fig 1 Schematic diagram of a BF tuyere showing a pulverized coal injection lance.Several types of coals are being used for PCI in the BF.In principle,all types of coals can be used for injection in BF,but coking coals are not used for injection since they are costly,have lower availability and are needed for the production of coke.Combustion TemperatureCombustion temperature has a significant effect on both NO and N 2 O emissions (Hiltunen et al.1991; Hiltunen,2006).NO emissions increase,but N 2 O emissions decrease,with increasing temperature.Higher temperatures promote the oxidation of nitrogen radicals to NO and reduce the char and CO concentrations,which in turn decrease the reduction of NO to N 2 on the char surface.
