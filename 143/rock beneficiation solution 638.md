## Chemical Beneficiation of Phosphate Rock E &amp; MJ
Figure 6—Proposed process for the treatment of phosphate rock using dilute nitric acid and hydrometallurgical techniques.The acid vapors can be condensed or washed with water for recycle.The residue,which typically analyzes 40% P 2 O 5,is insoluble in water but soluble in citric acid and can be marketed as a fertilizer or as a high grade phosphate product.Case Studies IritronASSMANG,Black Rock Beneficiation Plant Case Study The project encompassed the building of a beneficiation plant able to process up to 900 tons of manganese ore per hour in conjunction with TWP.Iritron did a complete electrical,instrumentation,control and communication system design and installation for the new beneficiation plant at BRMO.
