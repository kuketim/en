## Ore Deposit
Ore deposits that are associated with mafic to ultramafic igneous rocks can generally be divided into those where the metals of interest are hosted in oxide minerals and those where the metals of interest are held as sulfides or are strongly associated with sulfides (e.g.PGE alloys,arsenides,bismuthinides).The oxide ore bodies include stratiform,podiform,and breccia related chromite.Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper …Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.

## Leaching in Metallurgy and Metal Recovery
Leaching,by definition,is the process of extracting a substance from a solid material,after it has been in contact with a liquid.The substance being extracted from the solid does so by coming into solution,one which it is soluble in.Leaching Article about leaching by The Free DictionaryLeaching is also used to remove metals from their ores.In one procedure certain crushed ores of copper are placed into a series of tanks.As a solvent,such as sulfuric acid,is pumped into the first tank,it dissolves the copper from the ore.Eventually overflowing the first tank,the solution passes into the second,where more copper is.

## Copper
7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu (from Latin: cuprum) and atomic number 29.It is a soft,malleable,and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity.A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish orange color.Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity,as a building material,and as a constituent of various metal alloys,such as sterling.What Is a Metal Ore?Metal Ore Metal ore is a type of rock from which metal can be extracted.Metal ores are normally oxides; for example,aluminium is the most common metal in the Earth's crust,but in order to get as pure aluminium as possible,it needs to be extracted from an ore.

Ore loss occurs when material containing grade (ore) is incorrectly sent to a waste dump.When a cost is given for Ore Loss,it is the sale value of the metal (gold,copper) recovered from this ore (i.e.ore tonnes x grade x recovery rate x metal price).Dilution occurs when waste is unintentionally with material containing ore and sent to the.
