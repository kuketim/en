Reduced crusher speed increases the specific energy consumption of the crushing process by 50 150%,depending onF 10.Additionally,the product becomes less well graded. The lower size of the feed material (d and F 10) has a significant impact on the product particle shape.Energy Consumption in Mining Comminution19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;2.1 Energy Consumption in Open Pit Underground Mines There is a dearth of information about energy consumption specific to individual mines.One study [6],which is a collaboration that compares seven mine mill concentrator operations: four gold and three iron ore mines.The average energy needed for seven mines is summarized in figure 2,where
