## Production of Gold
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A feasibility study on the production of gold at a fictitious mine (Moapa mine) in Elko County,Nevada is to be performed.The mine is capable of producing 325,800 tons of high grade ore per year for 8 years.The deposit contains 0.12 ounces of gold per ton of high grade ore and can be acquired at a cost of $10 per ton of ore (cost of mining ore 13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Gold processing,preparation of the ore for use in various products.Native gold is the most common mineral of gold,accounting for about 80 percent of the metal in the Earth’s crust.It occasionally is found as nuggets as large as 12 millimetres (0.5 inch) in diameter,and on rare occasions.Major Mines &amp; Projects Twin Creeks MineOre from Turquoise Ridge mine is transported to Newmont’s Twin Creeks mill for processing.The refractory gold ore is treated by pressure oxidation technology and gold is recovered using conventional carbon in leach technology.Higher grade oxide ores are processed by conventional milling and cyanide leaching at the Juniper mill.18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Production from Fort Knox is up to 45,000 tonnes (50,000 short tons) per day of low grade ore (1 gram per tonne),with two mineral processing streams (carbon in pulp for higher grade ore and heap leaching for lower grade ore).The mine is located 42 kilometres (26 mi) from the city of Fairbanks via a combination of paved and unpaved roads.

## Gold processing 101
Gold bulls were disappointed that the price did not break through the $2,000 oz ceiling; nevertheless the current stable price run has helped to maintain a strong interest in gold projects.Gold processing has a couple of unique features.Ore processing is a 24 hour operation.Ore is stockpiled (1) at the processing plant,and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader.The ore is conveyed,and lime is added (2) to raise the pH of the ore.Following crushing through a jaw crusher (3),the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill (4) along.Gold Mining Gold Production World Gold Council17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;See our interactive gold mining map for gold production per country in 2016.Overall levels of mine production have grown significantly over the last decade,although substantial new discoveries are increasingly rare and production levels are increasingly constrained.Gold mining and mine production does not respond quickly to prices.Our operation is made up of an underground block cave mine,a sub level cave and an ore processing plant which produces copper concentrate for export.We will discover the copper and gold deposits to take us even further into the future.We are setting up future generations of Northparkes miners for ‘A century of mining together’.
