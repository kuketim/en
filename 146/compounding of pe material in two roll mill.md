## Standard Practice for Compression Molding,
Working a compound on a two roll mill prior to molding will disperse and distribute the compound additives in a manner that will affect the physical properties of the compound The relevant material specification or the material manufacturer shall be consulted to determine the need for milling a sample prior to compression moldingEPDM Compound with 1,2,5,and 10 phr Proaid LCF or.low CoF on their rubber surface by adding an incompatible material that bled to the surface.A few examples would be liquid chlorinated paraffin in EPDM,naphthenic.compound to get enough present at the surface.This may be a problem in cost and or.• Melt point is just 50°C (122°F) so dispersion is easy and mill addition is possible.

## Rubber Compounding
Polymer breakdown and subsequent compounding was historically accomplished on open roll mills,although today these operations are almost always performed in an internal mixer.The open mill consists of two metal rolls which are jacketed for temperature control.These rolls turn toward each other at fixed separations and often at different speeds.two roll mills for elastomersTwo roll Mills Every mixer must provide two basic functions,both equally important acceptable dispersion (intensive or dispersive mixing) and high uniformity (extensive or distributive mixing).The equipment used most often by the rubber technologist is the two roll lab mill a device for preparing small quantities of mixed compound.Two Roll Mixing Mill Two Roll Rubber Mixing Mill And,Variety of mixing equipment are available depending upon the kind of raw material to be blended Most of the mixing mills are driven by electronic motor and different models have different output Process The process is mixing is carried out between two contrary rotors
