## Superconducting high gradient magnetic separator.
A new superconducting magnetic separator incorporating a current carrying wire matrix with a background field,has been investigated.Within this matrix,magnetic particles carried by a fluid,are trapped by the wires.Theoretical studies show that firstly it is necessary to use bifilar wires.The tractive force exerted on the particles in this system,diminishes as the wire separation is.Fundamentals and Application of Magnetic Particles …In magnetic separation,the variation of the magnetic field generates a force that varies with distance as shown in Eq.(7).The force is usually very strong at near the magnet itself,where the cells are collected and retained,but decreases quickly with distance.This leads to a few limitations that must be considered.
