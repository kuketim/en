The residence time distribution (RTD) of mineral slurry and slurry holdup volume in an industrial ball mill has been successfully studies using tracer tests.Six different conditions of solids concentration and three levels of ball loading were assessed.The effects of the slurry solids concentration and the ball loading on the mean residence time of slurry were clearly depicted in the results.Fine Grinding as Enabling Technology The IsaMillThese features distinguish stirred mills as fundamentally different from both ball mills and Tower Mills,as demonstrated by Tables 1 and 2.‚Ä¢ the liberation impact in simple cases the grinding is simply to expose fine grained.Grinding energy is one of the major costs of mineral ‚Ä¶
