## Heap leaching Wikipedia
Heap leaching is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals,copper,uranium,and other compounds from ore using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and re separate them after their division from other earth materials Similar to in situ mining,heap leach mining differs in that it places ore on a.KPMG Mining Operational Excellence Framework4 KPMG Mining Operational Excellence Framework Retaining cost leadership Increase in cost of operation due to escalation in raw material cost (eg,explosive cost,electric power,etc) Certain costs of operations such as wages,utilities,construction and maintenance costs are quite sensitive to possible general price increas

## Copper Mining and Processing: Everything you Need to Know
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 9999% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday useThe most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.
