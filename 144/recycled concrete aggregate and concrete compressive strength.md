## Crushed Concrete Aggregates
2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Shear strength of recycled aggregate concrete is lesser than of normal concrete.This is because the recycled aggregate from field demolished concrete for example can be relatively weaker than a typical natural aggregate.In general,there is a 10% decrease in strength when recycled coarse aggregates are used.Effect of recycled coarse aggregate on concrete.The effect of recycled coarse aggregate on concrete compressive strength was investigated based on the concrete skeleton theory.For this purpose,30 mix proportions of concrete with target cube.
