## How to Identify Minerals in 10 Steps
A mineral's habit (its general form) can be especially useful for identifying some minerals.There are more than 20 different terms describing habit.A mineral with visible layers,like Rhodochrosite,has a banded habit.Amethyst has a drusy habit,where jagged projectiles line a rock's interior.Close observation and perhaps a magnifying glass.Evaluation of Acid Digestion Procedures to Estimate.Mineral analyses have been performed using as a digesting solution nitric and perchloric acid in a ratio ranging from 2:1 to 4:1 v v and with two digestion steps (AOAC,2000; Detmann et al.2012).Standardizing the ratio of acids used in the digestion of samples could increase the reliability of either information or comparison of results.
