## Impact Crusher Working Principle
Starting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them.Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic.An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill).Dynamic impact could be described as material dropping.Energy considerations in compressive and impact crushing …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The rock from the crushing plant needs to be reduced typically from the range 1 10 mm down to 0.05 0.1 mm in order for the flotation to work efficiently.For this size reduction,from 1 to 10 mm,down to the range 0.05 0.1 mm,wet tumbling mills are often used,in combination with hydrocyclones for size classification.

The work index W i was defined by F.Bond as the specific energy (kWh ton) required to reduce a particulate material from infinite grain size to 100 microns.The calculation is based on the size energy relationship e 1,2 =C.(1 x 2 n 1 x 1 n),which for n = 0.5,x 1 = ∞ and x 2 =100,by definition gives e∞,100 = W i and consequently C=10W i.EnergyEnergy is an international,multi disciplinary journal in energy engineering and research.The journal aims to be a leading peer reviewed platform and an authoritative source of information for analyses,reviews and evaluations related to energy.
