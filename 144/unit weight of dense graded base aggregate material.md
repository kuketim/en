## Construction Aggregate Calculator
Construction Aggregate Calculator Enter the width,length,thickness,and product density and hit the “Calculate” button to calculate your estimate.If you do not know the product density,use the optional density estimator* or contact a local sales representative.Density of AggregateDensity is an important parameter for aggregate.For aggregates,density is determined by multiplying the relative density (specific gravity) of the aggregate times the density of water.Bulk Density of Aggregate [1]The bulk density or unit weight of an aggregate is the mass or weight of the aggregate that required to fill a container of a specified unit volume.
