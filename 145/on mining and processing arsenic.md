Arsenic occurs in pure form only in small deposits.It occurs in many minerals,and usually is obtained as a byproduct from the mining,processing and refining of other minerals.Common arsenicbearing minerals include arsenopyrite,conichalcite,enargite,lollingite (iron arsenide),olivenite and orpiment.ore processing for arsenicArsenic trioxide can be generated via routine processing of arsenic compounds including the oxidation (combustion) of arsenic and arsenic containing minerals in air.Illustrative is the roasting of orpiment,a typical arsenic sulfide ore.2 As 2 S 3 + 9 O 2 → 2 As 2 O 3 + 6 SO 2.Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores.More 27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;arsenic produced by humans is released to the environment in the form of impurities in pesticides.Coal combustion also volatizes and releases arsenic as gases and fine grained aerosols to the atmosphere.At present,few mining plants are set to remove arsenic contained in ore and typically large amounts of arsenic are released as wastes.
