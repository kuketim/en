Explain the …Answer:In the extraction of copper from its Sulphide Ore,when ore is subjected to roasting some of it is oxidised to Cu2O which reacts with the remaining Cu2S to give copper metal.In this process,Cu2S behaves as reducing agent.2Cu2S+3O2+heat→2Cu2O(s.

## Copper Mining and Processing: Everything you Need to Know
Copper From Beginning to End Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man.It is found in ore deposits around the world.It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago.And as alloyed in.Copper Smelting ProcessModern copper smelters use processed copper ore fed into a flash furnace,typically fired by oxygen which produces blister copper,being further processed in a converter furnace.Molten copper is poured from here into rectangular moulds,the resulting ingots subjected to electrolysis producing a metal of 99.9% purity.Copper can be recycled indefinitely without the base metal being compromised.

## How is copper extracted from phytomining
Smelting is the process which ore goes through so that a metal can be extracted from it.It involves heating the rock to very high temperatures.Copper,for instance,can be.Copper SmeltingThe main differences of bioleaching from the chemical leaching involve that the leaching operates at room temperature,and the process proceeds with more slow speed.From the results of the studies [37 39],it is known that the factors influencing the recovery of nonferrous metals recovery from copper smelting slags in chemical (sulfuric acid) leaching also the ones influencing in bioleaching.

## Zinc The Essential Chemical Industry
This is because zinc reacts preferentially to iron in most environments to form protective layers of oxide,carbonate or other zinc reaction products that are resistant to subsequent corrosion by the atmosphere.Even if the coating is scratched it continues to corrode preferentially and protect the iron.Zinc is the sacrificial metal.What Is Copper Smelting? (with pictures)&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Each copper smelting operation has its own unique process,however many share similar basic steps.A typical process might begin with grinding of the ore into a powder.This powder is processed with chemicals and air to separate out some of the unwanted

## Manufacturing Process of Copper
Copper processing is a complex process that involves many steps as the manufacturer processes the ore from its raw,mined state into a purified form for use in many industries.Copper is typically extracted from oxide and sulfide ores that contain between 0.5 and 2.0% copper.
