## Extraction of Iron from Haematite Lets Learn Nepal
Extraction of Iron: Iron is extracted from its chief ore Haematite Fe 2 O 3.The various steps involved in the process are as follows: 1.Crushing: The ores are crushed in jaw crusher and powdered in ball mills.2.Concentration: The crushed ore is washed with steam or cold water to remove clay and sand.Extraction of Rare Earth Elements from Iron Rich Rare,process produces rare earth and iron ore concentrates for further beneficiation Upgrading some of rare earth ores was found to be challenging owing to the complexity of their mineralogy This was the case for two specific iron rich rare earth bearing ore deposits in the Southern African region

## Processes and Procedures in the Extraction of Iron,
15 02 2021&#0183;&#32;The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyerReduction of Metals (Extraction from Ore)There are 3 main methods of extracting metals from their ore.They are reduction of the ore with carbon,reduction of the molten ore by electrolysis,and reduction of the ore with a more reactive metal.Extraction using carbon Metals such as zinc,iron and copper.
