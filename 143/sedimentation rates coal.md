## Sedimentation Rate Definition &amp; Normal Range
A sedimentation rate is common blood test that is used to detect and monitor inflammation in the body.The sedimentation rate is also called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate because it is a measure of the red blood cells (erythrocytes) sedimenting in a tube over a given period of time.Sedimentation rate is often abbreviated as &quot;sed rate&quot; or ESR.Sedimentation rate based screening of oleaginous.The co combustion of microalgae biomass with coal has the potential to significantly reduce CO 2 emissions by eliminating expensive and carbon emitting downstream processes.In this study,the utilization of microalgal biomass as a direct combustion fuel in co firing industries and the screening of potential oleaginous strains of high calorific value was investigated.

Sedimentation rates,according to the constant rate supply model (CRS),ranged from 0.04 to 15.00 cm year.There was evidence of spikes in sedimentation rates for brief episodes; however,the average ranged from 0.14 to 3.04 cm year.In the north of the study area,the sedimentation rate was low,then increased to the center and the south.KGS Bull.
