## Copper processing
Extraction and refining The extraction of copper from ore is normally carried out in three major steps.The first step,mineral processing,is to liberate the copper minerals and remove waste constituents—such as alumina,limestone,pyrite,and silica—so that the copper minerals and other nonferrous minerals of value are concentrated into a product containing between 20 and 30 percent copper.Mineral dressing (= Orebeneficiation)Mineral dressing (= Orebeneficiation) The first process most ores undergo after they leave the mine is mineral dressing (processing),also called ore preparation,milling,and ore dressing or ore beneficiation.Ore dressing is a process of mechanically separating the
