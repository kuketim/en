Copper beads have been excavated in northern Iraq and which are more than ten thousand years old and presumably made from native copper,nuggets of which can sometimes be found.Copper was widely used in the ancient world as bronze,its alloy with tin,which was used to make cutlery,coins,and tools.In China it was used for bells.Solidification of Al Cu AlloysObservant people may have noticed that the Al Cu phase diagram shown only goes up to around 60%,by weight,of Copper.The Al Cu phase diagram is split at around 54wt%Cu by a particular phase.This &quot;split&quot; means that the two parts of the diagram can be considered separately.

Copper and zinc atoms are different sizes.This distorts the regular lattice structure in brass,so layers of atoms cannot slide over each other so easily.This makes brass stronger than copper or.Experimental and theoretical prediction of Copper Nickel.The average particle size for Copper is found to be 25 nm and that of Nickel is found to be 26 nm.This is also verified by the particle size analysis as claimed by Sigma.Both Copper and Nickel nanoparticles are agglomerated and seem to have a fairly even distribution of particles in terms of size.
