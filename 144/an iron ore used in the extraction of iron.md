CaO now reacts the impurities of ore called GANGUE to form slag.Slag is the mixture of CaSiO 3 and Ca(AlO 2) 2.The slag floats over the top of molten iron.Slag is a useful byproduct.It is used in road making,cement manufacturing a light weight buildingGCSE CHEMISTRY27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Extraction of Metals.History ().After the Bronze Age came the Iron Age.People discovered that a high temperature coal fire could be used for the extraction of iron from iron ore.The extraction of iron today is done in a blast furnace.The Iron Age began in Asia and Africa in 1,100 B.C.and came to Britain in 500 B.C.In many ways,we are still in the Iron Age take a look around.
