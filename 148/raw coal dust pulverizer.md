## Raw Coal Pulverizer
Raw Coal Pulverizer.Coal dribble or spillage is raw coal that is rejected through the pulverizer’s pyrite discharge This is caused when the velocity across the pulverizer throat is too low to maintain suspension of coal Air velocities through the pulverizer throat should be 7000 to 7500 Fpm when calculated on a …coal pulverizer control systemsCOAL PULVERIZER FUNCTIONALITY Raw coal is fed into the coal inlet,dried and ground to a fine dust on the grinding table.Hot air (inert gas) is used to pneumatically carry the coal dust upward through the classifier and into the transport pipe.EXPLOSION HISTORY Loss history for the past ten years due to dust explosions from FM Global Data.
