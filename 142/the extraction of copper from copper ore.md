## Extraction of Aluminum,Copper,Zinc &amp; Iron
Extraction of Copper Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) is the commonest copper ore.Copper is mainly extracted from the sulphide ore (Cu 2 S) by the self reduction process.The ores are often low grade (0.5%.Copper mining From ore to copper ,It is a measure of the value of copper that it is worth extracting it from such small concentrations The ore is a mixture of minerals and rock (called gangue ) The most common copper minerals are:

## How Extraction of Copper from Copper Pyrites?
Sulphide ores such as chalcopyrite are converted to copper by a dissimilar method from silicate,carbonate or sulphate ores.The principal ore of copper is copper pyrite and copper is extracted from this ore.Extraction of copper from copper pyrites involves theExtraction Copper Redox Anode scribdExtracting copper from other ores Copper can be extracted from non sulphide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: 1 In the CuFeS2 you would have to know that the copper and iron are both in oxidation state +2
