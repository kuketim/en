## Bauxite
Raw bauxite ores sourced from India,Guinea,Ghana,and United States were characterized and compared in terms elemental and mineral composition,fluoride adsorption affinity and capacity,surface area,and equilibrium suspension pH [24].Fig.12.4 shows images of each bauxite ore as received (before milling),after milling,and with scanning electron microscopy (SEM).The Chemistry and Processing of Jamaican Bauxite6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In October,1943,Alcan was incorporated under the name Jamaica Bauxites Limited as a Jamaican company to investigate the commercial potential of Jamaican bauxite.In the same year,2500 tonnes of ore was shipped to the USA for process investigation and it was realised that the bauxite was suitable for processing using Bayer technology.
