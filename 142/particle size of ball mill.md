## Ball Mill
The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.Effect of mill type on the size reduction and phase.Size analysis results for γ Al 2 O 3 particles showing (a) PSD and (b) cumulative PSD of as received (A R) samples and after milling in the single ball mill (SBM) for 1200 min,planetary ball mill (PBM) for 300 min and jet mill (JM) for 20 passes.
