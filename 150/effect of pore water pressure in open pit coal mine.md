## Control of groundwater in surface mining
&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The presence of groundwater in surface mining operations often creates serious problems.The most important is generally a reduction in stability of the pit slopes.This is caused by pore water pressures and hydrodynamic shock due to blasting which reduce the shear strength and seepage pressures,water in tension cracks and increased unit weight which increase the shear stress.Research and practice on fluctuation water injection.Research and practice on fluctuation water injection technology at low permeability coal seam.the constant increase in internal fissures and the constant decrease of the pore water pressure difference on both ends,the determination of the process changes of the pore water pressure difference in certain period of time will work out the.
