## Permeability (Earth sciences)
Permeability in fluid mechanics and the Earth sciences (commonly symbolized as k) is a measure of the ability of a porous material (often,a rock or an unconsolidated material) to allow fluids to pass through it.The permeability of a medium is related to the porosity,but also to the shapes of the pores in the medium and their level of connectedness.Practice problems: Porosity and bulk densityPractice problems: Porosity and bulk density Bulk density is the weight per unit volume of a soil sample.1.Calculate the bulk density of a 400 cm3 soil sample that weighs 575 g (oven dry weight).r b = M s V s = 575g 400cm 3 = 1.44g cm 3 2.Calculate the
