## Grinding
Grinding: Grinding is a process of removing material by abrasive action of a revolving wheel on the surface of a work piece in order to bring it to required shape and size The wheel used for performing the grinding operation is known as grinding wheel It consists of sharp crystal called abrasive held together by a binding material or bond The.GRINDING PARAMETERS CONVERSION CALCULATOR11&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;CALCULATING SFPM The performance of grinding wheels and quality of the finished workpiece is affected by how fast the abrasive grains sweep over the workpiece.That speed affects surface quality,workpiece burn,material removal rates,and other factors.Since the speed of the abrasives on the wheel perimeter depends upon the diameter of the wheel,RPM isn't a useful measure.
