## Asbestos MiningDiaries
The mineral asbestos attracted the industrialists of the 90s due to its numerous properties.Over the years,the dangers associated with various forms of asbestos were identified lowering the demand for this mineral worldwide.The Quebec government has stopped funding the mining of Asbestos shutting down the largest mine of the region: Jeffrey.The government has introduced new regulations to ban asbestos and products containing asbestos,but they don't apply to residues left from mining the carcinogenic material.Mining Companies and Asbestos Exposure Mesowatch13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Asbestos forms when the mineral peridotite reacts with extremely hot water.Since peridotite composes the majority of Earth’s upper crust layer,reactions transforming it into asbestos commonly occur.For this reason,miners find asbestos not just in designated asbestos mines,but also potentially anywhere on Earth.There are still places where asbestos mining is a notable industry: Canada’s asbestos mines—including the mine at Asbestos,Quebec,once the largest in the world—only closed within the last 10 years,and in Russia,the town of Asbest is still a major center of asbestos production.
