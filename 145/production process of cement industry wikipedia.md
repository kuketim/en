## production process of cement industry
Cement Gypsum calcining,Gypsum calcining,ball mill Overview.The cement industry has boosted efficiency by concentrating new capital investment in plants that use the dry process of cement manufacture,and by phasing out operations that rely on the more energy intensive wet process.Cement ProductionManufacturing cement at the Lafarge Seattle plant is by a “wet process”.As a result,raw materials are mixed with 30 to 40% water during grinding to form well mixed slurry.This wet process is advantageous due to the increased compatibility with wet climates and more uniform blending of raw materials prior to the kiln,along with lower kiln dust emissions.
