## flotation concentrate cnki
Remarkable improvement achieved by addition of a coal surface property modifier and replacement of two old flotation machines with two micro bubble ones that:under small variation of concentrate ash,flotation concentrate yield increased 8～10%,leading to increase of overall clean coal yield at 1.6～2.0% and considerable economic benefit obtained.Flotation of Low Volatile Coking Coal Fines SpringerLinkLow volatile coking (LVC) coal reserves have become the key for sustaining the coking coal production in India.Because of high ash content and difficult washability

## Kinetics of Coal Flotation
5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The reason for proposing this distribution is that in coal flotation,most of the material in the cell is the flotable component.In order to evaluate the suitability of the various models on the flotation time recovery profiles of the three coals,the results for flotation of the 100 and mesh wet ground coals were used.
