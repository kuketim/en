## Integrated Steel Plant TMT Bar Manufacturing Plants.
Molten Steel from EAF is tapped into a laddle and taken to the continuous casting machine.Liquid steel flows out of the laddle into the tundish and then into water cooled mold.Solidification begins in the mold.The continuous Billets coming out from the CCM is sized according to the length required.Rolling Mill with Thermex TechnologySECTION 2: STEEL REINFORCEMENTThe specially designed Thermex &#174; pipe assembly consists of chambers,nozzles and guide inserts,venturi guide etc.The pipe is designed in such a way that high pressure water jets flows in the rolling direction,creates uniform water pressure all around the surface of the bar,and keeps the bar floated in guide inserts when it passes through the Thermex &#174; pipe.
