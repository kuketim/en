2020 2 9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing,paper recycling and waste water treatment industries.Historically this was first used in the mining industry,where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.Gold dressing processGold content is very low in ore.To extract gold,need crush and grind ore and use mineral processing technology to pre concentrate or separate gold.For gold dressing,the gravity separation,flotation and cyaniding are widely used.The CIL are widely used in Africa.
