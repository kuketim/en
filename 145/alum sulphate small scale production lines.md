## Ammonium aluminium sulfate
Ammonium aluminium sulfate,also known as ammonium alum or just alum (though there are many different substances also called &quot;alum&quot;),is a white crystalline double sulfate usually encountered as the dodecahydrate,formula (NH 4)Al(SO 4) 2 &#183;12H 2 O.It is used in small amounts in a variety of niche applications; the dodecahydrate occurs naturally as the rare mineral tschermigite.Chemical cleaning of Alum scale from water treatment.The thinking is that the scale formed as the Alum contacted the carrier water and formed precipitates,most likely from minerals dissolved in the water.We've tried HCl and H2SO4 on scale samples in the lab and they didn't work.
