## What are the main methods of mining? American.
5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;There are four main mining methods: underground,open surface (pit),placer,and in situ mining.Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels,beach sands,or other environments.In situ mining.(PDF) Underground mining MethodsA 'read' is counted each time someone views a publication summary (such as the title,abstract,and list of authors),clicks on a figure,or views or downloads the full text.

## A bucket wheel dredge system for offshore tin mining.
Tin mining is a unique process due to the specific characteristics of the tin ore (known as cassiterite,SnO 2).This material has a relatively high specific gravity (SG s =4.3 7.0 depending on its purity) compared to sand at 2.65.Tin ore is usually found together with coarse sand,gravel,and sometimes clay in granular form with the grain diameter in the range of 0.1 64 mm (PT Timah Tbk.EPCMEquipment installation include the installation of crusher,screen,ball mill,classifier,flotation cell,thickener,filter and auxiliary equipment and so on.All the equipment are checked strictly before delivery and guarantee the high speed,shortcut,non damage.Whatever the stormy weather,deliver goods on time,don't waster customers' time.
