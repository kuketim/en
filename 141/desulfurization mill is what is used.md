## What Is Silicon Slag Used For AnyangHuatuoMetallurgy.
The silicon slag is excellent in desulfurization,the main reason is that the silicon slag contains a large amount of basic oxides,which can react with sulfur dioxide to form sulfates and the slurry can be used for flue gas desulfurization.So what is the desulfurization effect of silicon slag?Desulfurization gypsum uses and propertiesDesulfurization gypsum has few harmful components.When used as a cement retarder,it can basically replace natural gypsum.The prepared cement performance is not much different from that of prepared with natural gypsum,even the cement strength will be a certain increase.W
