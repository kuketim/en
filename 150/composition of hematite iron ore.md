## Difference Between Magnetite and Hematite,
Magnetite vs Hematite Magnetite and hematite are minerals of iron Both have iron in different oxidation states,and they are in the forms of iron oxid Magnetite Magnetite is an iron oxide with the chemical formula Fe3O4 Actually,it is a mixture of two iron oxides,FeO and Fe2O3 Therefore,this can be also [,]Hematite PhysicalHematite is dense and hard,it is the most important ore of iron because of its high iron content and its abundance.The mineral occurs in various habits: steel gray crystals and coarse grained varieties with a brilliant metallic luster are known as specular hematite.
