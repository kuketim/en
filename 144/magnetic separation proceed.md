## Magnetic nanoparticle drug delivery systems for …
Ferrite oxide—magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) is the naturally occurring minerals on earth which is widely used in the form of superparamagnetic nanoparticles for diverse biological applications,such as MRI,magnetic separation,and magnetic drug delivery.However,the use of magnetic nanoparticles in vivo needs lot of surface modification so as to protect them from reticuloendothelial system and.Concentration of Ores Study Material for IIT JEE.This method of separation is used when either the ore particles or the gangue associated with it possess magnetic properties.For example,chromite Fe(CrO 2) 2 being magnetic can be separated from the non magnetic silicious gangue by magnetic separation.This method is widely used for the separation of two minerals,when one of them happens to be magnetic.
