## Froth Flotation Process
FROTH FLOTATION “So many variables influence flotation that it will be long before every one of them can be investigated and its influence on the process determined.” The froth flotation process was patented by E.L.Sulman,H.F.K.Pickard,and John Ballot in 1906,19 years after the first cyanide processflotation separation process Liming Crusher4) The ore slurry surface can be adjusted in the flotation cell.In the flotation separation process,sometimes it needs to adjust the thickness of the foam layer and the pulp flow.And for the whole flotation process,the work is a continuous process.5) High flotation efficiency and low energy consumption.6) Simple structure and easy to operate.
