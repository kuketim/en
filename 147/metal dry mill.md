## Which is better: dry or wet machining? Cutting Tool.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;When near dry milling with MQL,the tool’s cutting edge works inside a mist formed from oil and compressed air,which is sprayed directly into the cutting zone.Depending on the design of a machine tool and milling cutter,the mist is delivered externally or internally through the cutter.The main function of MQL is to lubricate the cutting edge.Dry Grinding Attritors: Batch or Continuous MillsIn the batch mode,material is charged into the mill at the top,ground for a predetermined time,then discharged through grids at the bottom.The system can easily be sealed for grinding under inert gases such as nitrogen or argon.The SD Attr
