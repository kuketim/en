## Coal
Coal is a hard rock which can be burned as a solid fossil fuel.It is mostly carbon but also contains hydrogen,sulphur,oxygen and nitrogen.It is a sedimentary rock formed from peat,by the pressure of rocks laid down later on top.Peat,and therefore coal,is formed from the remains of plants which lived millions of years ago in tropical wetlands,such as those of the late Carboniferous period.Coal to liquids: Can fuel made from coal replace gasoline? …And thus,dirty old coal can outperform even the sexiest,shiniest,new state of the art natural gas combined cycle power plants that get 50 to 55 percent efficiency.Coal’s use today is much cleaner and more efficient than ever before,and it will continue on that trend.

## How a Coal Plant Works
Coal fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam.The steam produced,under tremendous pressure,flows into a turbine,which spins a generator to create electricity.The steam is then cooled,condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the process over.The Economics of CoalThe U.S.exports both steam or thermal coal,used to generate electricity,and metallurgical (met) coal,which is used in the steel making process.While global demand for thermal coal is strong,coal destined for steel production is the most profitable for producers.

The vanadium leaching process from stone coal was reviewed,including its leaching condition,application circs and its respective merits and faults.Although no salt roasting and dilute acid solution leaching technology had the advantages of low cost,high vanadium leaching efficiency as well as low pollution,this technology could not be applied for all stone coal.Coal fired power plant13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Coal fired power plants are a type of power plant that make use of the combustion of coal in order to generate electricity.Their use provides around 40% of the world's electricity and they are primarily used in developing countries.Countries such as South Africa use coal for 94% of their electricity and China and India use coal for 75% of their electricity needs,however the amount of coal.

## Coal formation
Coal is a solid,black,readily combustible fossil fuel that contains a large amount of carbon based material approximately 50% of its weight.The formation of coal takes a significant amount of time (on the order of a few million years),and the first coal bearing rock units appeared about 360 million years ago,at a time known as the Carboniferous or &quot;coal bearing&quot; Period.Coal gasificationCoal gasification is the process of producing syngas—a mixture consisting primarily of carbon monoxide (CO),hydrogen (H 2),carbon dioxide (CO 2),natural gas (CH 4),and water vapour (H 2 O)—from coal and water,air and or oxygen.Historically,coal was.
