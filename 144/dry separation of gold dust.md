## Dry Separation Method Triple S Dynamics
Dry separation equipment first appeared over a century ago when the fluidized bed separator,then called the specific gravity separator,was invented by Edwin Steele and Henry Sutton [1] Constructed of wood,early gravity separators were originally developed to concentrate gold and other metallic ores without using waterCrusher an overview ScienceDirect TopicsA gold ore was crushed in a secondary crusher and screened dry on an 1180 micron square aperture screen The screen was constructed with 012 mm diameter uniform stainless steel wire The size analysis of the feed,oversize and undersize streams are given in the following table

## The Gold Smelting Process Melting,Smelting & Refining,
Jan 18,2017&#0183;&#32;Gold smelting is an important process in the production of gold It enables gold miners to separate impurity materials from pure gold that is desirable in the market Smelting often produces gold to the purity over 90% To improve the quality of the gold mined,gold miners have to refine the goldDry Separation MethodsDry separation methods can basically be broken down into three main types of mechanical separation procedures: air classification,screening and specific gravity separation.FIGURE 1.A common dry separation process is the recycling of heavy metals,such as copper Process engineers are routinely challenged with the ubiquitous problem of how to.
