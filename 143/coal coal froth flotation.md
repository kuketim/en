## Effect of microemulsified collector on froth flotation of coal
Froth flotation is a fine particle separation process,based on the difference in surface hydrophobicity of different components.It is often very effective for coal cleaning,since coal is naturally hydrophobic and minerals are generally hydrophilic.Because of coal’sNIOSHTIC Publications SearchIn the 2nd stage,the froth product from the 1st stage is subjected to froth flotation by using a coal flotation depressant and a pyrite flotation collector,thus removing most of the fine pyrite.Thus,100 lb of coal containing ash 31.8,Total s 2.23 and pyritic s 1.70 pct was ground and floated at ph 6.2 By using potassium amyl xanthate 0.5,Pine oil 0.05,Aero depressant 633 1.0,and hcl 0.

## Coal Flotation Technical Review
New flotation processes reviewed in this report are highly efficient and available competitively for the Australian Coal Industry.With commercial suppliers of new technology already well established,any new research,however prospective the ideas may be,is likely to return little or no benefit to the Industry.Fine Coal Froth Flotation DeviceThe Coal Research Bureau of the School of Mines at West Virginia University,using a modified design of a Russian flotation device,was able to obtain a clean coal product containing 7.64 percent ash with 94 percent yield and 97 percent coal recovery.This favorable performance was obtained with the semi pilot scale flotation cell operating as a simulated three stage unit on slurry taken from.
