## A Cyclone Furnace for Slag Fuming
Since granulation of lead blast furnace slag started at Port Pirie in 1921 the stockpile of this material has increased to nearly 5 million tons which averages 17&#183;5 per cent zinc by weight.Although a number of processes for recovering the zinc have been examined,economic considerations indicate that a slag fuming process is likely to be most suitable.Blast Furnace SlagOther Properties Because of their more porous structure,blast furnace slag aggregates have lower thermal conductivities than conventional aggregates.(21) Their insulating value is of particular advantage in applications such as frost tapers (transition treatments in pavement subgrades between frost susceptible and nonfrost susceptible soils) or pavement base courses over frost susceptible soils.
