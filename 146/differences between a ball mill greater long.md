## Closed Circuit Grinding VS Open Circuit Grinding
Metallurgical ContentOpen Circuit GrindingClosed Circuit GrindingGrinding Circuit Process Control VariablesGrinding Operating Costs The simplest grinding circuit consists of a ball or rod mill in closed circuit with a classifier; the flow sheet is shown in Fig.25 and the actual layout in Fig.9.This single stage circuit is chiefly employed for coarse grinding when a product finer than 65.Ball Mills vs Rod MillsWhen the mill is rotated without feed or with very fine feed,the rods are in parallel alignment and in contact with one another for their full length.New feed entering at one end of the mill causes the rod charge to spread at that end.This produces a series of wedge shaped slots tapering toward the discharge end.The tumbling and rolling rods expend most of their crushing force on the.
