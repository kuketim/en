## Cement
6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Cement Cement Extraction and processing: Raw materials employed in the manufacture of cement are extracted by quarrying in the case of hard rocks such as limestones,slates,and some shales,with the aid of blasting when necessary.Some deposits are mined by underground methods.Softer rocks such as chalk and clay can be dug directly by excavators.The excavated materials are transported.Cement Production1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Modern day cement is an unusual industrial product produced in huge quantities in special plants that can produce nothing else.It is produced by a combination of unusual unit operations involving mining,very fine scale blending of raw materials,very high temperature clinkering reactions,controlled cooling,grinding,blending,and finally shipping under controlled conditions.
