## Froth Flotation Method
(2) When the flotation machine is used to treat polymetallic gold and silver ores,concentrates containing gold,silver and non ferrous heavy metals can be effectively separated,which is conducive to the comprehensive utilization of valuable mineral resources.Metallurgist &amp; Mineral Processing EngineerIt is,therefore,decidedly to the advantage of the shipper to reduce gold and silver to bullion if his ore is amenable to treatment by amalgamation or cyanidation.In some instances recovery of part of the gold and silver by these processes and of the remainder in concentrates may be …

## Extraction of Gold by Flotation Process
Extraction of gold by flotation process is based on the difference of physical and chemical properties of the ore surface,and is processed by flotation reagent to make the useful mineral adhere to the bubble to achieve the purpose of gold extraction.Flotation of gold and gold bearing oresSilver ethyl xanthate is the species formed on pure silver above 30 mV and on a gold silver alloy of equal gold and silver content at around +20 mV.From this,it is obvious that the flotation of gold silver alloys can be achieved at potentials considerably lower than those for gold.
