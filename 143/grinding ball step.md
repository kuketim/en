## Mill (grinding)
Ball mills are commonly used in the manufacture of Portland cement and finer grinding stages of mineral processing,one example being the Sepro tyre drive Grinding Mill.Industrial ball mills can be as large as 8.5 m (28 ft) in diameter with a 22 MW motor,[4] drawing approximately 0.0011% of the total world's power (see List of countries by electricity consumption ).Grinding Mill Design &amp; Ball Mill Manufacturer3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;For a number of years ball mill grinding was the only step in size reduction between crushing and subsequent treatment.Subsequently smaller rod mills have altered this situation,providing in some instances a more economical means of size reduction in the coarser fractions.The principal field of rod mill usage is the preparation of products.
