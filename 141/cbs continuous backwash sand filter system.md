## Sand filter
Sand filters are used as a step in the water treatment process of water purification.There are three main types; rapid (gravity) sand filters,upward flow sand filters and slow sand filters.All three methods are used extensively in the water industry throughout the world.The first two require the use of flocculant chemicals to work.An Introduction To Slow Sand FiltrationTypes Of Sand Filter 4 1.2.Rapid Sand Filters These filters use coarser sand than slow sand filters and the effective size of the filter media is usually greater than 0.55 mm.The flow rates are normally between 4 and 21 m h equating to 400 to 2100 l h per m2 of filter.
