## 3.3
The ingredients listed above include both naturally occurring materials such as limestone and clay,and industrial byproduct materials such as slag and fly ash.From Table 3.3 it may seem as if just about any material that contains one of the main cement elements can be tossed into the kiln,but this is not quite true.Raw Materials.Lime Component Limestone: Common forms of calcium carbonate used as raw material for cement manufacturing are limestone and chalk.Limestone is of predominently fine grained cryistalline structure,its hardness is between 1.8 to 3.0 of the Mohs scale of hardness and specific gravity 2.To 2.8.Limestone usually contains admixtures of clay substance or iron …

## Rawmill
A raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into &quot;rawmix&quot; during the manufacture of cement.Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln,which transforms it into clinker,which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement,and has a larg
