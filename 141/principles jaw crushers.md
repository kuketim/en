## Mining Industry: What Is Jaw Crusher's Working Principle.
This product regards a motor as power,drives an eccentric shaft by using a triangle belt and sheave through motor pulley,makes motive jaw conduct reciprocating motion as desired trajectory,crushes materials in the crushing cavity composed by fi.Jaw CrusherThe gyratory crusher can,just like a jaw crusher,accept boulder sizes close to 1.5 m (for the largest equipment). This crusher can handle products with a Mohs hardness that is not necessarily less than 5. As is the case for jaw crushers,there is not any mutual sliding on grinding surfaces,but simply rolling of the nut on concaves.
