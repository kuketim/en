&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Summary The Ball Mill is designed to grind materials by turning the cylindrical shell with grinding medium (e.g.steel balls) put in the shell,and has a simple structure and ease of handling.Furthermore,The Ball Mill of a large capacity has been available to a very extensive range of applications in both dry anDipl. Ing.Th.Fahrland,Dr. Ing.K. H.Zysk,Loesche GmbH.There is no question that vertical roller mills like the Loesche Mill offer significant advantages over ball mills in terms of their energy efficiency.As noted in a current publication (1) the specific power consumption of a ball mill is higher than that of a vertical roller mill …
