## Process equipment Our equipment Mills
Ball Mills.Ball mills operate by introducing the material to be milled into a rotating vessel which contains grinding media (e.g.high density balls or rods) and the material is ground by attrition through the tumbling action of the mill.Vertimill&#174;It is also faster to install than a traditional ball mill,significantly reducing initial costs.Lower operating cost.Vertimill&#174; is an energy efficient grinding machine.They tend to grind more efficiently than for example ball mills with feeds as coarse as 6 mm to products finer than 20 microns.
