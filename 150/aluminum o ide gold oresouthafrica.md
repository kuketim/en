## Bayer process
The Bayer process is the principal industrial means of refining bauxite to produce alumina (aluminium oxide) and was developed by Carl Josef Bayer.Bauxite,the most important ore of aluminium,contains only 30 60% aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3),the rest being a mixture of silica,various iron oxides,and titanium dioxide.AluminumAluminum is often found combined with oxygen.This is called aluminum oxide,the natural resource that's mined for aluminum oxide is a mineral called bauxite.Aluminum was first extracted in 1825 by Hans Oersted,but it wasn't until the late 1880s when it

## What is Aluminium oxide soluble in?
Aluminium oxide is soluble in aromatic organic solvents.I am aware of the amphoteric nature of aluminum oxide and what organic solvents are.I opted to replace the item from the manufacturer.Preventing Cracking of Anodized Coatingsprocess,the aluminum oxide reacts with water to form aluminum hydroxide,which fills pores in the coating and seals the surface.The coefficient of thermal expansion of aluminum is about five times greater than that of aluminum oxide [ 5].As a result,anodized
