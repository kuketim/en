## Open pit mining
Open pit,open cast or open cut mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow.This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth,such as long wall mining.Acid mine groundwater in lignite overburden dumps …During the different stages of lignite mining (front face,open pit,recultivated overburden dump; see Fig.2),pyrite within the sediments was affected by oxidation of different intensity.A initial strong oxidation took place at different floors and slopes of the surface mine as a consequence of the direct contact of pyrite with atmospheric.

## Pyrite: The mineral pyrite information and pictures
Pyrite was once used as a source of sulfur,but is now only a minor ore for both sulfur and iron.Pyrite from some localities is auriferous,and therefore is used as an ore of gold in gold bearing localities.Pyrite was polished by the Native Americans in the early times and used as mirrors.Today,it is used as an ornamental stone,as well as a very popular stone for amateur collectors.Iberian Pyrite BeltMining operations at Cerro Colorado open pit (Riotinto) operated by Atalaya Mining.The Riotinto project has proven and probable reserves of 153 Mt @ 0.45 % Cu,cut off grade of 0.20 % Cu (11 2016) and is producing currently 5.0 Mtpa and in the expansion
