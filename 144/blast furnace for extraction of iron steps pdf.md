## Preparation of Titanium rich Raw Material from Titanium.
According to the component properties and characteristics of high titanium blast furnace slag in Panzhihua,the other main impurity components in titanium bearing blast furnace slag were removed to make titanium rich raw material for industrial use by low.Blast FurnaceBlast furnace gases contain close to 30% CO 2,after full combustion of the CO fraction,while the overall flue gas stream from an integrated steel mill is ∼15% CO 2.The same CO 2 capture options introduced above for power generation plant can therefore also be applied to a steel mill:.CO 2 capture from the overall flue gas stream.Firing the blast furnace with oxygen rather than air.

## Blast Furnace Process
&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Important properties of sinter for blast furnace process are reducibility,size and size distribution,cold and hot strength,and softening and melting behavior.Typical sinter suitable for blast furnace process is from 15 to 25 mm,as is illustrated in Figure 1.1.10 [22].Another important property is the disintegration of sinter in reduction,which occurs during the transformation of hematite.Blast furnace metallurgy Britannica7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Blast furnaces produce pig iron from iron ore by the reducing action of carbon (supplied as coke) at a high temperature in the presence of a fluxing agent such as limestone.Ironmaking blast furnaces consist of several zones: a crucible shaped hearth at the bottom of the furnace; an intermediate zone called a bosh between the hearth and the stack; a vertical shaft (the stack) that extends from.

## Processes and Procedures in the Extraction of Iron.
The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process.The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace.These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyeres.Iron Ore Processing for the Blast FurnaceIron Ore Processing for the Blast Furnace (Courtesy of the National Steel Pellet Company) The following describes operations at the National Steel Pellet Company,an iron ore mining and processing facility located on the Mesabi Iron Range of Minnesota.

1.The diagram shows the Blast Furnace for the extraction of iron from its ore,taken as haematite.Write the equation(s) for each of the following reactions: a) the formation of carbon monoxide in the furnace; b) two reactions in which haematite is reduced to iron;The Extraction of IronExtracting iron from iron ore using a Blast Furnace.The common ores of iron are both iron oxides,and these can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke.Coke is produced by heating coal in the absence of air.Coke is cheap and provides both the reducing agent for the reaction and also the heat source.

## Blast furnace
A blast furnace is a type of metallurgical furnace used for smelting to produce industrial metals,generally pig iron,but also others such as lead or copper.Blast refers to the combustion air being &quot;forced&quot; or supplied above atmospheric pressure.[1] In a blast furnace,fuel (coke),ores,and flux (limestone) are continuously supplied through.Extraction of Iron Metallurgy Blast Furnace and ReactionsA Blast furnace is a gigantic,steel stack lined with refractory brick where the concentrated iron ore,coke,and limestone are dumped from the top,and a blast of hot air is blown into the bottom.All the three ingredients are crushed into small round pieces and mixed and put on a hopper which controls the input.

Blast Furnace.In the Blast furnace,reduction of iron oxides takes place in different temperature ranges.Hot air is blown from the bottom of the furnace and coke is burnt to give temperature upto about 2200K in the lower portion itself.The burning of coke therefore supplies most of the heat required in the process.
