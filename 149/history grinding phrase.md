## 'Keep your nose to the grindstone'
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;What's the origin of the phrase 'Keep your nose to the grindstone'? There are two rival explanations as to the origin of this phrase.One is that it comes from the supposed habit of millers who checked that the stones used for grinding cereal weren't overheating by putting their nose to the stone in order to smell any burning.Tasbih1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The phrase can be roughly translated as &quot;Praised be God&quot; or &quot;Glory (be) to God&quot;.A more literal translation is,&quot;Free is God.&quot; or &quot;Void is God.&quot; The root of the word سبحان (subḥān) is derived from the word سبح (sabaḥa = to swim float on the surface),giving the phrase a meaning that God is above any imperfection or false descriptions.
