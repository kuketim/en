## 2017 OSHA Silica Dust Exposure &amp; Control Regulations.
2017 OSHA Silica Dust Exposure Regulations In order to improve worker safety standards,the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,or OSHA,passed a new ruling on June 23,2016 that aims to reduce the amount of silica dust that workers breathe in on jobsites.Mechanochemistry of silica on jet milling&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The size reduction and mechanochemical effect of silica take place simultaneously as the jet mill is an energy intensive grinding mill.The minimum particle size obtained was 3.15 μm with span value of 1.30 and crystallinity values of ground product ranging from 71% to 91%.
