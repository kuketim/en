## Barite Mining And Processing
Barite is extracted by both surface and underground mining and most barite requires upgrading to achieve minimum density or purity levels.Processing methods such as crushing and milling is often followed by wet gravity concentration methods,for example spirals and jigging to remove gangue minerals and produce correctly sized product.BariteBarite is also known as baryte,and in Missouri is known as &quot;tiff”.The primary countries in which commercial deposits of barite are currently found are the United States,China,India and Morocco.Barite’s high density and chemical inertness make it an ideal mineral for many applications.
