## Fly ash
Fly ash material solidifies while suspended in the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags.Since the particles solidify rapidly while suspended in the exhaust gases,fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and range in size from 0.5 &#181;m to 300 &#181;m.The major consequence of the rapid cooling is.Automatic fly ash brick making machines,Micro …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The strength of fly ash brick manufactured with the above compositions is normally of the order of 7.5 N mm2 to 10 N mm2.Main ingredients include fly ash…
