Mining for coal can be divided into two major categories,underground mining and strip mining.Underground mining obtains coal by digging downwards to the level of the coal and then horizontally extracting the coal through a variety of methods.In contrast,strip mining simply removes the overlaying earth and then extracts the coal directly.Coal miningCoal mining Coal mining Underground mining: In underground coal mining,the working environment is completely enclosed by the geologic medium,which consists of the coal seam and the overlying and underlying strata.Access to the coal seam is gained by suitable openings from the surface,and a network of roadways driven in the seam then facilitates the installation of service facilities.
