## Ball mill
A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis.The axis of the shell may be either horizontal or at a small angle to the horizontal.It is partially filled with balls.The grinding media are the balls,which may be made of steel ( chrome steel ),stainless steel,ceramic,or rubber.Analysis on the grinding operation condition of ball mill.The ball mill and the rod mill are the most commonly used grinding equipment in the dressing plant,so what is the difference between the operation of the two grinding equipment? Sometimes we think,why do we have a ball mill for a dressing plant,but with a rod mill,why? Today we analyze

## Ball Milling
Ball milling is suggested as a novel method for enhancing filler dispersion in different matrices that is environmentally and economically sustainable [85].It is a solid state mixing of powders,usually performed with ball mills,which enables intimate mixing of the constituents through repetitive plastic deformation.Advantages and Disadvantages of Overflow Ball MillsXinhai multiple types of wet overflow ball mills and cone overflow ball mills,with some huge share of domestic and foreign ball mills market.The reason why Xinhai overflow balls can be applied such widely in grinding process is that Xinhai is committed to innovate and develop,constantly optimizing the overflow ball mills.
