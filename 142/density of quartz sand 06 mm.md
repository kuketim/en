## Crystal quartz (SiO2) and Fused Silica
Crystal quartz (SiO2) is a very useful material for fabrication of finished optics: laser beamsplitters,AO elements,polarizing optics,prisms,windows,lenses in the ultraviolet because of its high UV,VIS and NIR transmittance,birefringence,ability to rotate plane polarized light,high damage threshold and resistance to scratching.Black sand mineral BritannicaBlack sand,accumulation of fragments of durable heavy minerals (those with a density greater than that of quartz),usually of a dark colour.These accumulations are found in streambeds or on beaches where stream and wave energy was sufficient to carry away low
