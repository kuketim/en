## Direct Reduced Iron and its Production Processes IspatGuru
Direct Reduced Iron and its Production Processes Direct reduced iron (DRI) is the product which is produced by the direct reduction of iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state by using non coking coal or natural gas.Direct Reduced Iron (DRI)Hot Direct Reduced Iron (HDRI) is iron not cooled before discharge from the reduction furnace,immediately transported to a waiting electric arc furnace and charged thereby saving energy.The direct reduction process uses pelletized iron ore or natural &quot;lump&quot; ore.

## Direct Reduction of Iron Ore
Direct Reduction of Iron Ore The Midrex Direct Reduction process is based upon a low pressure,moving bed shaft furnace where the reducing gas or syngas moves counter current to the lumpiron oxide ore or iron oxide pellet solids in the bed.Direct reduced iron processThe heart of the direct reduction is the shaft furnace,which is filled from the top with lump ore and pellets.Carbon monoxide and hydrogen are used to dissolve out the oxygen in the iron ores.In contrast to the blast furnace process,however,these reduction gases.
