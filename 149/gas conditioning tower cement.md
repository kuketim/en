## Cooling tower Wikipedia
An HVAC (heating,ventilating,and air conditioning) cooling tower is used to dispose of ("reject") unwanted heat from a chiller Water cooled chillers are normally more energy efficient than air cooled chillers due to heat rejection to tower water at or near wet bulb temperaturThe humidifying tower in cement plant is prone to.14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The main function of humidifying tower in cement plant technology is to humidify the kiln tail waste gas of dry kiln,reduce the specific resistance of high temperature dust in the exhaust gas,improve the working efficiency of electrical dust collection at the kiln tail,protect the environment,recycle dust and reduce material consumption.Of course,cement plant humidification tower prone to.

## Water and power consumption reduction by gas …
Gas conditioning tower (GCT) is a vital equipment in cement industries.The main principle in this equipment is evaporative cooling,i.e.reducing the temperature of the hot flue gas by evaporation of cooling water.Thus,the water consumption is large enough to be able to cool the hot gas from about 400 &#176;C to 150 &#176;C or less.Gas Conditioning Towers Redecam GroupGas conditioning towers (GCT) are used in industrial applications to cool gases upstream,ahead of bag filters,electrostatic precipitators or our Dual Action Filters They are considered to be the most effective type of cooling systems in treating exhaust process gas
