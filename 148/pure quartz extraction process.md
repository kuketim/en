## Extraction and purification of quartz in rock using hot.
Quartz extraction and purification is essential for the successful measurement of 10 Be and 26 Al by AMS for exposure dating.The common procedure involves repetitive etching by ultrasonic heating and agitation in a dilute aqueous HF solution (2% w w),which has proven adequate for quartz rich rock (i.e.granite,quartzite).Mineral ExtractionMineral Extraction There are two basic types of extraction: surface and sub surface (deep),each relying on a variety of techniques.Regardless of process,U.S.legislation requires operators to submit a plan for restoring the land and mitigating acid mine drainage before a permit is granted for mining operations.
