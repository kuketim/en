## Gold extraction Wikipedia
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.Function Of Activated Carbon For Gold Mining Austro CarbonAdsorption of golden complexes (notably ion dicyanoaurate) on activated carbon is the cornerstone of modern methods for gold extraction procedure.This practice is extremely powerful and is now a significant element in enhancing the growth of their gold mining industry during the previous 25 years (S.Mansooreh,Tahereh Kaghazchi,2007).
