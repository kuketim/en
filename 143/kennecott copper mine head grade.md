The Bingham Canyon Mine is the largest man made excavation on Earth.It measures two and three quarter miles across at the top and three quarters of a mile deep.The Bingham Canyon porphyry copper gold molybdenum deposit is one of the largest and highestKennecott Copper MineKennecott Copper Mine! On a school day! Would we ride minecarts into the bowels of the Earth? Would we get to wear those hard hats? Would we see the seven dwarfs? Over the next few hours we sat in conference rooms while people from the Kennecott corporate offices indoctrinated us with anti environmentalism propaganda.
