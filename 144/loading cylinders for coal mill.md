## INTRODUCTION TO BOWL MILLS
2002 6 26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;introduction to bowl mills Coal is the one of the most dominating energy source because of its cost,availability and transportability.Pulverized form of coal has made modern steam generating units highly thermal efficient,reliable,safe and able to efficiently use of low grade coals.Variables in Ball Mill Operation Paul O.Abbe&#174;Ball mill operation is often regarded as something of a mystery for several reasons.Ball milling is not an art it’s just physics.mill speed,media size,solids loading and residence time.For most companies the production mill already exists so we can ignore mill diameter and focus on the other variables.cylinders or mixed sizes.
