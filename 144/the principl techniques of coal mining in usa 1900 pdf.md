## Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Coal Mining Activities …
Surface mining also known as strip mining,is the most common type of mining of coal in the world responsible for ∼8% of coal production in China,80% in Australia,and 67% in the United States ().The bed of soil and rock,covering the coal bed (commonly referred as “overburden”) is first removed using draglines,power shovels,bulldozers,and front end loaders to expose the coal seam.www.fortcox.ac.za2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Foreword During its year history the concept of sustainability has been the object of scientific and political discussion,with varying degrees of intensity, promoted with v
