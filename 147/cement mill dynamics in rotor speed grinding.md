## Finding failure
During mill operation roller surfaces wear down,which results in a higher dynamic load,peaks which exceed the nominal torque and,in general,an instable mill operation and lower performance.In many instances,bearing failures at the rolls are caused by excessive dynamics in the grinding process.(PDF) DYNAMIC DESIGN FOR GRINDING MILL FOUNDATIONSThe dynamic analysis of grinding mill foundation is a typical problem of soil structure interaction.The sub structure method is used to carry out the dynamic analysis and design in practice.
