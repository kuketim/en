## Bauxite The Aluminum Association
Bauxite is primarily comprised of aluminum oxide compounds (alumina),silica,iron oxides and titanium dioxide.Approximately 70 percent of the world’s bauxite production is refined through the Bayer chemical process into alumina.Alumina is then refined into pure aluminum metal through the Hall H&#233;roult electrolytic process.Mining bauxiteThe Process of Mining BauxiteThe Process of Mining Bauxite.by Dajcor Aluminum.Bauxite is a mineral that contains varying amounts of combined water and several impurities of which ferric oxide and silica are usually predominant.It is found in a belt around the equator and is generally extracted by open cast mining.Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared.

## Aluminum Smelting Furnaces and Processing of Bauxite Ore
The smelting of aluminum begins with the extraction of bauxite ore by a form of open cast mining.The bauxite is washed and screened before being converted to alumina,a white powdery element from which the aluminum is produced.Aluminum smelting is carried out in a Hall Heroult reduction cell,which is lined with carbon.A mix of alumina and cryolite is fed into the cell and carbon blocks.machine used in bauxite mining and processing PhilippinesBauxite Crusher machine Bauxite Crushing Plant Philippines Mining used bauxite Home &gt; Quarry and mining &gt; equipment used in bauxite mining and processing.bauxite mining process equipment,bauxite.Bauxite crusher machine: In the bauxite crushing process,bauxite crusher is used to crush bauxite ore into small particles.Usually,there are.
