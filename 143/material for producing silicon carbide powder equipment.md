## Silicon carbide manufacturing process
Fine silicon particles can be converted to silicon carbide (SiC) by heating in the excess carbon from the organic material.The silica fume,which is a byproduct of producing silicon metal and ferrosilicon alloys,also can be converted to SiC by heating it with graphite at 1500&#176;C (2730&#176;F).Boron CarbideUnlike boron carbide,silicon carbide is basically a line compound with essentially no range of stoichiometry.There are many polytypes of silicon carbide.These structures can be easily visualized by recognizing that they are all built up of hexagonal double layers where the double layer consists of a layer of silicon atoms in a hexagonal pattern over a layer of carbon atoms in a hexagonal layer.
