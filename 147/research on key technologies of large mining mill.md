The life cycle of mining begins with exploration,continues through production,and ends with closure and postmining land use.New technologies can benefit the mining industry and consumers in all stages of this life cycle.ThisMiningOre mills generate large amounts of waste,called tailings.For example,99 tons of waste are generated per ton of copper,with even higher ratios in gold mining because only 5.3 g of gold is extracted per ton of ore,a ton of gold produces 200,000 tons of tailings.(As time goes on and richer deposits are exhausted and technology.
