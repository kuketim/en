What is Sedimentary Rock? Sedimentary rocks form when layers of sand,mud,organic matter and eroded particles deposit as sediments at the bottom of the rivers,lakes,and oceans.This deposition of layer over layers continues for millions of years until the bottom layers slowly turned into rocks due to compressive forces exerted by the top layers.Igneous Metamorphic And Sedimentary RocksIgneous Metamorphic And Sedimentary Rocks.Displaying top 8 worksheets found for Igneous Metamorphic And Sedimentary Rocks.Some of the worksheets for this concept are Rocks and minerals,Reading comprehension work and kids fable,Name types of rocks,Igneous rocks,Metamorphic rocks,Rocks and minerals,Rock work,Chapter 2 alaskas igneous rocks.
