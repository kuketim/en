## What is roasting of a sulfide ore?
The concentrated ore ( received after crushing and floating) is roasted in a furnace in the presence of a current of air.Sulphur is oxidized to SO2 and impurities of arsenous and antimony are removed as volatile oxides.The following reaction ta.What is Sulfide Mining? Mining Action GroupMetallic sulfide mining (aka hard rock mining) is the practice of extracting metals such as nickel,gold and copper from a sulfide rich ore body.Sulfides are a geologic byproduct of mining in this area,and by exposing sulfides to the air and water in our atmosphere,sulfuric acid can be created — threatening to poison the nearby water.
