The mineralization at Musselwhite can be classified as an Iron Formation hosted gold deposit.Typically,gold in these deposits occurs in cross cutting quartz veins and veinlets or as fine disseminations associated with pyrite,pyrrhotite,and arsenopyrite hosted in iron formations and adjacent rocks within volcanic or sedimentary sequences (McMillan 1996).Chapter 272&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Most microbes in cooling systems can be controlled by chlorine or bromine treatment if exposed to a sufficient residual for a long enough time.A free chlorine residual of 0.0.5 ppm is adequate to control bulk water organisms if the residual can be maintained for a sufficient period of time.
