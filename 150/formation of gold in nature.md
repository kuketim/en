Platinum is found in its pure native form or in platiniridium,a natural alloy of platinum and iridium.Platinum is present in thin sulfide layers in certain mafic igneous bodies and is mined in Canada,Russia,South Africa,the USA,Zimbabwe and Australia.Some platinum is obtained as a by product of copper and nickel processing.Gold processing BritannicaGold processing,preparation of the ore for use in various products.Native gold is the most common mineral of gold,accounting for about 80 percent of the metal in the Earth’s crust.It occasionally is found as nuggets as large as 12 millimetres (0.5 inch) in diameter,and on rare occasions.
