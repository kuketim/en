## Magnetic separation Wikipedia
Magnetic separation is a process in which magnetically susceptible material is extracted from a mixture using a magnetic force.This separation technique can be useful in mining iron as it is attracted to a magnet.In mines where wolframite was mixed with cassiterite,such as South Crofty and East Pool mine in Cornwall or with bismuth such as at the Shepherd and Murphy mine in Moina,…
