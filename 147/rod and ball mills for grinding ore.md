## Ball Mill VS Rod Mill
For ball mill,the grinding force of steel ball to ore is less than the impact,because the contact area is small between balls and mineral.Thus,the throwing motion of ball can produce a large impact,but it need a high rotate speed and has a higher power consumption.But for rod mill,grinding effect is better which need a lower rotate speed.Rod Mills for coarse grinding FLSmidthOur Rod Mills are available in multiple diameters to fit the needs of your operation.Grinding,primarily by attrition,Rod Mills require comparatively low levels of power to operate.Rod Mills can be either wet or dry designs.Once replaced by AG and SAG mills,Rod Mills have had a recent resurgence in the industry.

Unlike the Ball Mill,however,the Rod Mill uses rods instead of balls as the grinding medium.As a result,its uses are different from those with the Ball Mill.In other words,the Rod Mill gives impact on and grinds coarse particles present between each rod,while no fine particles receive impact and are ground.
