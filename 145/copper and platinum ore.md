Canada Nickel (CVE: CNC) has discovered a palladium and platinum bearing zone,situated to the north of the nickel cobalt deposit within its wholly owned Crawford project in Ontario.Five holes.Sulfide OresCopper sulfide ores must be concentrated before they can be economically transported and smelted.The universal technique for this concentration is froth flotation of finely ground ore.Froth flotation entails attaching fine Cu sulfide mineral particles to bubbles and floating them out of a water ore mixture.
