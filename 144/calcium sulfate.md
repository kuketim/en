## Calcium sulfate
Calcium sulfate is a virtually insoluble inorganic compound with the formula CaSO 4.It is commonly formed as a by product of reactions.Since it's hygroscopic,it's commonly encountered as hydrate.Properties Chemical A very exothermic thermite reaction occurs with aluminium powder,which is used to 'heat boost' reactions such as a titanium dioxide thermite,where the extra heat is needed to.CALCIUM SULFATE CAMEO Chemicals NOAACALCIUM SULFATE is non combustible.Decomposes to give toxic oxides of sulfur,but only at very high temperature (&gt;1500 C).Generally of low reactivity but may act as an oxidizing agent: incompatible with diazomethane,aluminum,and phosphorus.Certain.
