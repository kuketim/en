## Welding of wood in the presence of wollastonite.
5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The wollastonite used in this study was a minimally refined powder that consisted of a mixture of various sizes of acicular particles (with a large proportion of the particles being approximately 0.05 to 0.1 mm in the longest direction).The wollastonite powder was sourced from the Sv&#229;rts&#229;ngs mine in Filipstad,Sweden,Sweden.Powder FlowContinuous processing requires the powder to flow from one piece of equipment to another; therefore,powder flow is the first critical attribute to consider when determining if a powder is eligible for a particular process route.Compressibility,or the ability of the powder to irreversibly deform under pressure and make hard compacts,is the.
