## Iron and Zinc Nutrition among Premenopausal Women
Abstract Iron deficiency affects approximately 12% of women of childbearing age in Australia and reduces the body’s capacity to transport oxygen,impeding physical performance and cognitive ability.Zinc deficiency can lead to a range of non specific symptomsIron Deficiency&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Iron (Fe) is a component of hemoglobin,myoglobin,and many enzymes in the body.Heme iron,contained mainly in animal products,is absorbed much better than nonheme iron (eg,in plants and grains),which accounts for &gt; 85% of iron in the average diet.85% of iron in the average diet.
