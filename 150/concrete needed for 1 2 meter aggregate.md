## CONCRETE MIXING RATIOS
A concrete mixture ratio of 1 part cement,3 parts sand,and 3 parts aggregate will produce a concrete mix of approximately 3000 psi.Mixing water with the cement,sand,and stone will form a paste that will bind the materials together until the mix hardens.The strength properties of the concrete are inversely proportional to the water cement.CONCRETE MIXING RATIOSWhen making concrete it's important to use the correct concrete mixing ratios to produce a strong,durable concrete mix.To make concrete there are four basic materials you need: portland cement,sand,aggregate (stone),and water.The ratio of aggregate to sand to cement is an important factor in determining the compressive strength of the.
