## Autogenous and Semi Autogenous Mills
The larger diameter and short length provide better impact breakage for the competent ore.9.3.Several workers have attempted to determine the power draw for autogenous and semi autogenous mills.with the total mass between 200 and 250 kg.The rock pieces are charged in a cylindrical drum 1.8 m in diameter and the drum rotated at 26 rpm.Grinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process ControlGrinding in ball mills is an important technological process applied to reduce the size of particles which may have different nature and a wide diversity of physical,mechanical and chemical characteristics.Typical examples are the various ores,minerals,limestone,etc.The applications of ball mills are ubiquitous in mineral

## A Review of Advanced Ball Mill Modelling
Simulated breakage rates for a copper ore as a function of particle and steel ball size for a ball mill (top) and DEM median impact energy and collision frequency as a function of ball size (bottom),where M b is the mass of the ball charge (30 % mill filling and 67 % of critical speed in a 0.3 m diameter mill).Grinding Mills&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The product size from a rod mill is much coarser.Hence a rod mill generally precedes a ball mill in a grinding circuit especially where a fine size product is required.Ball Mills: The final stages of comminution are performed in tumbling mills using steel balls as the grinding medium and so designated &quot;ball mills.&quot; Since balls have a greater.
