## AVAILABLE AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES FOR REDUCING.
Cement is a finely ground powder which,when mixed with water,forms a hardening paste of calcium silicate hydrates and calcium aluminate hydrates.Cement is used in mortar (to bind together bricks or stones) and concrete (bulk rock like building material made from cement,aggregate,sand,and water).INDUSTRIAL CASE STUDY THE EMENT INDUSTRYMost California cement plants have a “reverse peak” electric load profile (i.e.their demand is lower during the peak hours) because they consciously defer peak load.They try to stockpile certain crushed products when they can so that they can shut down or slow down large process mills or fans during the on peak hours.

## Manufacture of Portland cement
Portland Cement.Cement: is a material with adhesive and cohesive properties which make it capable of bonding minerals fragments into a compact whole.For constructional purposes,the meaning of the term &quot;cement&quot; is restricted to the bonding materials used withMills &#187; Products &#187; CEMTECCement mills Double chamber ball mills for the cement industry come in various designs: For bearings,either slide or slide shoe bearings can be chosen.Possible drives include gear rim pinion,lateral,or central drives.If the processing material is wet,cement mills.
