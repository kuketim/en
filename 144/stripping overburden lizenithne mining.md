Stripping costs are those costs incurred when removing overburden or waste materials in order to obtain access to a commercially producible ore body.If so,and the activity provides better access to the deposit,then under GAAP the cost should be capitalized along with other development costs.along with other development costs.PAminingA Marion 7500 dragline stripping overburden to uncover met coal.# marion # marion7500 #7500 # dragline # earthmoving # miningshovel # walkingdragline # shovel # megamachines # heavyequipmentlife # equipment # machines # bigmachines # miningexcavator # earthmover # miningpower # bigiron # heavyequipment # miningequipment # coal # coalregion # mining # …

## stripping overburden line mining
&#183; In surface mining operations,entities may find it necessary to remove mine waste materials ('overburden') to gain access to mineral ore deposits.This waste removal activity is known as 'stripping'.There can be two benefits accruing to the entity fromStripping ratioIn mining,stripping ratio or strip ratio refers to the ratio of the volume of overburden (or waste material) required to be handled in order to extract some tonnage of ore.For example,a 3:1 stripping ratio means that mining one tonne of ore will require mining three tonnes.
