## China domination makes tungsten critical
Based on this drilling,it was estimated that the Lost River skarn deposit hosts some 23.53 million short tons of resource averaging 16.43 percent fluorite,0.26 percent tin,and 0.04 percent tungsten trioxide that could be mined by open pit methods; and 1.28 million tons of 11.66 percent fluorite,0.15 percent tin,and 0.01 percent tungsten trioxide considered more suitable for underground.How Tungsten Is MinedDespite the large amount of ore that is pulled out from either mining method mentioned or any other used,it is surprising to know that most tungsten minerals contain less than 1.5 percent useful tungsten.This is found in tungsten trioxide.
