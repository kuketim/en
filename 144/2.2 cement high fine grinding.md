## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product.Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules,usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter.It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.Raw Material Drying GrindingGrinding Operation Objectives and KPIs: Highly energy intensive unit operation of size reduction in cement industry is intended to provide a homogeneous,dry (&lt;0.5% moisture) and super fine ( 20% residue on micron sieve) raw meal powder for clinkerization process in kiln (Dry Process).Grinding operation is monitored for following.

## Cement Grinding
Cement grinding operation may be performed in one of the following mill setups.Ball and tube mills.Vertical Roller Mills (VRM).Roller press with Ball mill.Ball Mill.Ball mills with high efficiency separators have been used for cement grinding in cement plants all these years.Ball mill is a cylinder rotating at about 80% of critical.All about Cement Lafarge3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;All about Cement.Grinding produces a fine powder,known as raw meal,which is preheated and then sent to the kiln.The kiln is at the heart of the manufacturing process.Once inside the kiln,the raw meal is heated to around 1,500&#176;C it is of a similar temperature to molten lava.In order to heat the materials to this very high.
