## Plastic limit bearing calculation of blasting roof in deep,
In other countries,deep hole mining is widely used due to its high efficiency and safety This approach,specifically the Vertical Crater Retreat (VCR) mining method,was introduced in China in the 1980s After decades of development,the VCR method has become the epitome of efficient and safe miningNIOSHTIC 2 Publications Search 10005188 Research Study,Large diameter (6 1 2 in) blastholes were an integral part of the stoping method at each mine A true vertical crater retreat (VCR) method was used at the Homestake Mine,while a vertical bench mining method (VBM) was used at the Carr Fork Mine

## Vertical crater retreat mining in the Sudbury Basin,
VCR has gradually supplanted other mining methods until today about three quarters of the Sudbury output is obtained using VCR VERTICAL CRATER RETREAT MINING IN THE SUDBURY BASIN Vertical crater retreat mining History The vertical crater retreat mining method is based on CW Livingston's crater blasting theories and was developed by Inco and.Edumine Mining courses Professional Development,This course refers to the generic mining method of sublevel stoping The most commonly used sublevel stoping mining methods are sublevel open stoping,long hole open stoping or blasthole stoping,and vertical crater retreat (VCR) Variations of this method include vein (Alimak) mining,transverse stoping,Avoca and longitudinal mining
