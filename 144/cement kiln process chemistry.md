History2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Cement Chemistry.Cement is chiefly of two kinds based on the way it is set and hardened: hydraulic cement,which hardens due to the addition of water,and non hydraulic cement,which is hardened by carbonation with the carbon present in the air,so it cannot be used underwater.The kiln process in cement plant causes the emission of carbon.

## Cement Clinker Calcination in Cement Production …
The cement clinker calcination is an important step in the cement production process.It mainly occurs in cement kiln and can be roughly divided into six reaction stages,namely drying,preheating,chemical decomposition,exothermic reaction,sintering and cooling.&quot;The most important books of the Cement Industry&quot;10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Rotary Cement Kiln,1986 Second Edition by Kurt E.Peray. .If you want to learn the basic principles of operation of a cement kiln,this is the book you should read.

## Manufacturing process Lafarge
2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The cement manufacturing process starts from the mining of raw materials that are used in cement manufacturing,mainly limestone and clays.A limestone quarry is inside the plant area and a clays quarry is as far from the plant area as 25 km.Alternative fuels co processing in cement.Here,local authorities often offer subsidies for waste processing,bringing added economic benefits to the cement plant operations.With cement production processes consuming such a large amount of energy,the opportunity is clear for cement plant operators to introduce alternative fuels co processing to their combustion and production processes.
