## Centrifugal fan
A centrifugal fan is a mechanical device for moving air or other gases in a direction at an angle to the incoming fluid.Centrifugal fans often contain a ducted housing to direct outgoing air in a specific direction or across a heat sink; such a fan is also called a blower fan,biscuit blower [citation needed],or squirrel cage fan (because it looks like a hamster wheel).Planetary Ball Mill PM 100The extremely high centrifugal forces of a planetary ball mill result in very high pulverization energy and therefore short grinding times.The PM 100 is a convenient benchtop model with 1 grinding station.You may also be interested in the High Energy Ball Mill Emax,an entirely new type of mill for high ene

The only difference between the wheels tested was the manufacturing process used to create them.One was a fully machined wheel (the red map) and the other was the standard,high quality cast wheel (the blue map).Looking at a cast wheel vs a billit wheel of the EXACT SAME DESIGN.The differences seen are well within the testing tolerances set.
