## Free Gold Lode &amp; Placer Claim
The Free Gold Claims consist of a 40 acre placer and two 18 acre lodes that overlap most of the placer.The claims are located on the northwestern slopes of the Harquahala Mountains about 5 miles from highway 60 and the small town of Wenden,Arizona in La Paz County.Prospecting Placer Gold Deposits26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Prospecting for placer gold,except perhaps in the case of buried placers,is the simplest form of prospecting.Gold,platinum,and tin are the principal metallic minerals won from placers,but gold (alloyed with varying percentages of silver) is the only metal that has been recovered in commercially important quantities from placers in the United States.

## How to Find Gold in the Wild [+5 Tried and True …
Placer gold is essentially gold found in a secondary deposit,which has been corroded away from the primary lode.Placer gold is then carried away by rain,snowmelt,and rivers,streams,and creeks running through a lode deposit.The nuggets and flakes of the gold are carried downstream from its originating source,just waiting to be discovered.Placer mining29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Placer mining ˈ p l &#230; s ər is the mining of stream bed deposits for minerals.This may be done by open pit (also called open cast mining) or by various surface excavating equipment or tunnelling equipment.Placer mining is frequently used for precious metal deposits (particularly gold) and gemstones,both of which are often found in alluvial deposits—deposits of sand and gravel in.

## Prospecting Lode Gold Deposits
7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Gardner has emphasized the importance of panning likely looking pieces of float in prospecting for lode gold.Since gold is a stable metal unaffected by ordinary solvents,it is more likely to be retained in the rock until freed by mechanical wearing away of other minerals than are most other metallic constituents.Lode1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;One of largest silver lodes was the Comstock Lode in Nevada,although it is overshadowed by the more recently discovered Cannington Lode in Queensland,Australia.The largest gold lode in the United States was the Homestake Lode.The Broken Hill Lode in South Australia is the largest lead zinc lode ever discovered.
