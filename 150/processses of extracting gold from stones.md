## How Is Gold Extracted From Gold Ore? Sciencing
Gold is usually found alone or alloyed with mercury or silver,but can also be found in ores such as calaverite,sylvanite,nagyagite,petzite and krennerite.Most gold ore now comes from either open pit or underground mines.The ores sometimes contain as little as 5 100 of an ounce of gold …9 Step Process for Discovering,Mining &amp; Refining GoldGold miners too take special care to make the impact of mining for gold as light as possible.Reclaiming land to its previous natural state is the final and perhaps most important step to ensuring the process of obtaining gold doesn’t result in permanent damage to the landscape.
