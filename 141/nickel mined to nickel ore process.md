## Nickel
Nickel is a silver metal with a slight golden tinge with the symbol Ni and is atomic number 28.Nickel occurs mostly in combination with sulfur and iron.Nickel can only be economically mined from two types of ore deposits,the first one being laterites and the second being magmatic sulfide.Nickel Mountain Mine Near Riddle,Oregon The …of co is contained in the lead ore mined annually 2n the district but no attempt is made to save it.recovery of some of this might be possible if the process used by national lead could be applied to these ores.and boxwork of quartz and garnierite in nearly fresh peridotite.all zones have some nickel and are mined.layer (3) has highest.

## Nickel: smelting,producing Metalpedia
Nickel: smelting Extraction and purification Nickel is recovered through extractive metallurgy: it is extracted from its ores by conventional roasting and reduction processes that yield a metal of greater than 75% purity.In many stainless steel applications,75% pure nickel can be used without further purification,depending on the composition of the impurities.Nickel The Canadian Encyclopedia2015 11 20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;process flowsheet into which the new separation process is inserted.After the initial leaching process of the nickel ore or concentrate,and subsequent liquid solid separation,purification is needed to remove: a) Copper,if present in commercial quantities,by solvent extraction.
