## How Cement Is Made
Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains.The cement is now ready for transport to ready mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects.Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement,some kilns in the United States use a wet process.From raw materials to NORM by productsDepending on the production process,the quantity of slag per produced quantity of metal can vary.It was estimated by Gorai et al.that for every ton of copper 2.2 ton of slag is produced (Gorai and Jana,2003).Proctor et al.estimated that 220 370 kg blast furnace slag is produced per ton of produced iron (Proctor et al.2000).6.5.1.2.

## Role of Slag in Converter Steelmaking IspatGuru
In all slag metal reactions there is a ratio between how much of one thing is in the steel and how much it is in the slag.This is called the ‘partition ratio’.The steel and slag in the converter need to be balanced so that they are in the state of equilibrium.Characteristics and utilisation of copper slag—a reviewCopper slag (CS) is a by product obtained from the process of copper manufacturing (Schlesinger et al.2011),with approximately 40 million ton of the slag generated annually worldwide (Obe et al.

All data on quan tification of phosphorus sources are presented in terms of total phosphorus (i.e.kilograms (kg) of total phosphorus per metric ton (MT) of product,or metric tons of total phosphorus per year).One metric ton is equivalent to 1,000 kg or 2,205 lb.Results o~ this study are presented in subsequent sections of this report.Iron oreIron ores[1] are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted.The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey,bright yellow,or deep purple to rusty red.The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3O 4,72.4% Fe),hematite (Fe 2O 3,69.9% Fe),goethite (FeO(OH),62.9% Fe.
