A mixture with an excess of cement paste will be easy to place and will produce a smooth surface; however,the resulting concrete is not cost effective and can more easily crack.Portland cement's chemistry comes to life in the presence of water.Cement and water form a paste that coats each particle of stone and sand—the aggregates.Type I II Cement Concrete Construction MagazineType I II portland cement satisfies requirements for both Type I and Type II.Strength requirements meet those for Type I,and composition requirements meet those for Type II.The dual type cement can be used where either type is specified.It cuts down on the costs of producing and storing two cements.

## Cement
A cement is a binder,a substance used for construction that sets,hardens,and adheres to other materials to bind them together.Cement is seldom used on its own,but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry,or with sand and gravel,produces concrete.Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is only behind water as.The Chemical Composition of ConcreteIn Portland cement,5% of its chemical composition is the gypsum mineral.The major compounds that make up Portland cement are tricalcium silicate,dicalcium silicate,tricalcium aluminate,tetracalcium aluminoferrite and gypsum.Once this process is

## Portland cement clinker
Portland cement clinker overview.Portland cement clinker is a dark grey nodular material made by heating ground limestone and clay at a temperature of about 1400 &#176;C 1500 &#176;C.The nodules are ground up to a fine powder to produce cement,with a small amount of gypsum added to control the setting properties.This page gives a thumbnail sketch.How to Mix Portland Cement With Sand HunkerPortland cement is made up of a number of compounds,but primarily consists of limestone and clay.It can be mixed with water,sand and other materials for use in building and sculpting projects.Portland cement is so named because the color of the cement is akin to the limestone from the Isle of Portland in the English Channel.

## Manufacture of Portland cement
Chemical composition of Portland cement The raw materials used in the manufacture of Portland cement consist mainly of lime,silica,alumina and iron oxide.These compounds interact with one another in the kiln to form a series of more complex products and,apart from a small residue of uncombined lime which has not hadcement Definition,Composition,Manufacture,History.This article surveys the historical development of cement,its manufacture from raw materials,its composition and properties,and the testing of those properties.The focus is on portland cement,but attention also is given to other types,such as slag containing cement and high alumina cement.
