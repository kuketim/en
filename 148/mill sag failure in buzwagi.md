absorption so a failure of mill bearings,(normally the weakest link),is typical.Other costly types of damage that occur from falling charge,although less frequent,are cracks in the mill heads and shells.LOCKED CHARGE STARTS AND YOUR GRINDING MILL Authors: Jeff Belke &amp; Mitch Bertrand Damaged radial bearingINSURABILITY OF LARGE GEARLESS MILL DRIVESlarge mills,as the financial impact of a failure is proportional to the through put of the mill.Despite the occurrences of these events,as mining operations are driven by lower ore grades and the ability to continue reducing operating costs per ton,the trend for having larger mills is still very present and there is no reason
