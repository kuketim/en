## Ball Mills
The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.Patterson IndustriesLiquid Discharge Lids and grinding door covers for Ball Mills.PATTERSON&#174; Urethane Lined Pebble Mill Door for 6’0” dia.PATTERSON&#174; Pebble Mill Top Side As above Bottom Side 18&quot; Babitted Replacement Bearings for PATTERSON&#174; Ball Mill.
