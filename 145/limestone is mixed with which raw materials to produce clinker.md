## Cement Clinker Calcination in Cement Production Process …
At this stage,ground raw materials will be sent into the cement kiln and be heated at a high temperature to produce chemical reactions with each other,eventually forming clinker.In addition,clinkers that just complete the calcination will have a high temperature,thus a cooling machine is usually placed behind the rotary kiln so that the clinker can go directly into the cooler for dropping.Cement clinkerCement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product.Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules,usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter.It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.

## What is Cement Clinker? Composition,Types &amp; Uses
Clinker is primarily used to produce cement.Since it can be stored in dry condition for several months without noticeable deterioration,it is traded internationally in large amounts.Cement manufacturers buy clinker for their cement plants in areas where raw materials for cement are scarce or unavailable.CEMENT RAW MATERIALS9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The quality of cement clinker is directly related to the chemistry of the raw materials used.Around 80 90% of raw material for the kiln feed is limestone.Clayey raw material accounts for between 10 15%,although the precise amounts will vary.Magnesium carbonate,which may be present in limestone,is the main undesirable impurity.The level
