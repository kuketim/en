## Friction and Friction Coefficients
3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The friction force is the force exerted by a surface when an object moves across it or makes an effort to move across it.The frictional force can be expressed as.F f = μ N (1).where.F f = frictional force (N,lb).μ = static (μ s) or kinetic (μ k) frictional coefficient.N = normal force between the surfaces (N,lb) There are at least two types of friction forcesHow a Thickener Works2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;How a Thickener Works.The Dorr traction thickener is the type most frequently used for heavy duty work with large tonnages.This probably is the reason why thickening rates in the cyanide plant are sometimes appreciably reduced when an ore is being milled which has partially oxidized in the mine and consequently contains appreciable.
