## IsaMill
The IsaMill is a stirred medium grinding mill,in which the grinding medium and the ore being ground are stirred rather than being subjected to the tumbling action of older high throughput mills (such as ball mills and rod mills).Stirred mills often consist of stirrers mounted on a rotating shaft located along the central axis of the mill.Effect of circulating load and classification efficiency.The effect of circulating load and classification efficiency on the performance of ball mill circuits is compared to the effect on HPGR circuits.of rod mills does not.of achieving a finer.
