## Ball Mill Grinding Theory
The total feed to the ball mill was therefore 11.54 T.per hr.or 179 per cent,of the original feed.It was evident that the ball mill was greatly underloaded in this test,but so much trouble developed in the classifier,due to the tendency of the sands to slip down the slopes,that a more rapid feed was not attempted at this time.What is a ball mill? What are its uses and advantages?Energy Saving Ball Mill * Product Introduction A high efficiency and energy saving ball mill with rolling bearing * Capacity Up to 160t h * Product Improvement Cylindrical energy sav
