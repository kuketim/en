## Ball Mill Design Power Calculation
The basic parameters used in ball mill design (power calculations),rod mill or any tumbling mill sizing are; material to be ground,characteristics,Bond Work Index,bulk density,specific density,desired mill tonnage capacity DTPH,operating % solids or pulp density,feed size as F80 and maximum ‘chunk size’,product size as P80 and maximumTypes of PavementsTypes of Pavements.There are two types of pavements based on design considerations i.e.flexible pavement and rigid pavement.Difference between flexible and rigid pavements is based on the manner in which the loads are distributed to the subgrade.
