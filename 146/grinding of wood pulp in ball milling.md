## Factors Affecting Ball Mill Grinding Efficiency
Factors Affecting Ball Mill Grinding Efficiency The following are factors that have been investigated and applied in conventional ball milling in order to maximize grinding efficiency: a) Mill Geometry and Speed Bond (1954) observed grinding efficiency to be a function of ball mill diameter,and established empirical relationships for.Grinding System ZetaThe NETZSCH Zeta &#174; grinding system has a wide range of applications and is equally suited both for processing very low viscosity products and grinding products with a high solids concentration and correspondingly high viscosity,and everything in between.The product wetted components are available in various materials.Depending on the application,materials such as NElast,ceramic,abrasion.16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The relative influence of ball milling for various time periods on the course of enzymatic and dilute acid hydrolysis was investigated.The response of enzymatic hydrolysis to the extent of milling was quite dramatic.Cotton linters pulp was totally hydrolyzed in 10 days with 60 min of milling.
