## Cement Bond Log Tecnode Solutions
Cement Bond Tool detects the bonding of the cement to the casing and formation.Casing that is not bound to the cement or formation has a higher vibration than that which is bound.Hence this causes less energy from the sonic signal to be transferred to the formation and the reflection energy is higher.Cement bond logsOur bond tools evaluate the cement bond quality and integrity to both pipe and formation by providing the measurements of the cement bond amplitude (CBL) through near receiver (3 ft crystal),and variable density log (VDL) through far receiver (5 ft Crystal).

The Cement Bond Logging tools have become the standard method of evaluating cement jobs.They indicate how good the cement bond is.A cement bond log (CBL) documents an evaluation of the integrity of cement job performed on an oil well.It is basically a sonic tool which is run on wireline.AnaLog Services on Cement Bond Logging2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;See our Cement Bond Log Notes for logging tips,Simultaneous Gamma Ray SIE Cement Bond Logging for how that is accomplished,and Paul Knight's Care and Feeding of SIE Cement Bond Tools for maintenance tips.The foregoing is an oversimplified discussion of cement bond logging; most theoretical background and interpretative information has been.

## cement bond log Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary
A log that uses the variations in amplitude of an acoustic signal traveling down the casing wall between a transmitter and receiver to determine the quality of cement bond on the exterior casing wall.The fundamental principle is that the acoustic signal will be more attenuated in the presence of cement than if the casing were uncemented.Cement Evaluation A Risky Business2016 10 18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Cement Evaluation A Risky Business Glen Benge Benge Consulting SPE 170712.Cement Evaluation Requirements.Knowing the.the cement bond log is probably one of the most abused,misused,and misunderstood logs used in the.available logging data

## CEMENT BOND LOG INTERPRETATION
3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Cement Bond Log (CBL) gives a continous measurement of the amplitude of sound pulses from a transmitter to receiver.This amplitude is maximum in unsupported pipe and minimum in well cemented casing.Cement Bond Logging TechniquesThe scope pictures are used qualitatively because it was not possible to relate absolute amplitudes with the commercial tools.It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts involved in acoustical cement bond logging as outlined in several earlier papers on the subject.
