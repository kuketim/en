## PPT
Open Pit Mining.Explanation: Open pit mining,also known as open cut mining,and strip mining,refers to a method of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit.Most of the time,when the mining company is done with it,the pit is used as a landfill.A landfill is used as a dump to get rid of our garbage.Surface Mining Methods and Equipment16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;UNESCO EOLSS SAMPLE CHAPTERS CIVIL ENGINEERING Vol.II Surface Mining Methods and Equipment J.Yamatomi and S.Okubo &#169;Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems (EOLSS) Figure 2.Change in production and productivity of US coal mines The higher productivity for open pit mining equipment also lowers costs.
