## Comminution processes: Basics and application to energy efficiency
Importance of high energy efficiency High energy efficiency and,thus,low specific energy requirement for demanded product fineness (quality) is important because • Low energy costs • High production capacity because • Low contamination and wear costs pre tonSix Steps for Sizing ShocksAccelerating and decelerating loads in a prescribed time is essential for operator safety as well as economy and efficiency of motion to optimize the machines’ output.Often,machine parts move at extremely high speeds and must be decelerated or stopped
