## Silicon Carbide SiC Material Properties
29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Silicon carbide is composed of tetrahedra of carbon and silicon atoms with strong bonds in the crystal lattice.This produces a very hard and strong material.Silicon carbide is not attacked by any acids or alkalis or molten salts up to 800&#176;C.In air,SiC forms a protective silicon oxide coating at 1200&#176;C and is able to be used up to 1600&#176;C.The Mohs Scale of Hardness for Metals: Why It Is …6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;People often hear about the Mohs scale of hardness when it is used to compare gemstones,but this system is also used to rank metals.Let’s see how the scale of metal hardness can be useful to you and how the metals used in jewelry compare on it.

## Mohs' Hardness (Typical) of Abrasives
2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mohs' Hardness (Typical) of Abrasives table from READE.Abrasive blasting for surface preparation is an important step in providing a foundation for protective coatings.For years,tests have concluded that high performance coatings provide excellent corrosion protection and durability when applied over a blast cleaned surface with a consistent anchor profile.CorrosionpediaThe hardness of materials is defined as the resistance of a specific material to localized plastic deformation or indentation.The term may also be used to describe the resistance of the material to scratching,abrasion or cutting.With respect to metals,hardness is most commonly used to assess its ability to resist permanent deformation due to concentrated applied loads.
