## Crystalline silica and silicosis Safe Work Australia
Crystalline silica is found in sand,stone,concrete and mortar.When workers cut,crush,drill,polish,saw or grind products containing silica,dust particles are generated that are small enough to lodge deep in the lungs and cause illness or disease includingSilica NanoparticlesSilica Nanoparticles Silica,or silicon dioxide,is the same material used to make glass.In nature,silica makes up quartz and the sand you walk on at the beach.Unlike metals such as gold and iron,silica is a poor conductor of both electrons and heat.Despite.
