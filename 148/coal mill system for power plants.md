## Coal fired power plant
24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Coal fired power plants are a type of power plant that make use of the combustion of coal in order to generate electricity.Their use provides around 40% of the world's electricity and they are primarily used in developing countries.Countries such as South Africa use coal for 94% of their electricity and China and India use coal for 75% of their electricity needs,however the amount of coal.Thermal power plant as contributed by coal mill …Abstract: In recent years,the load following capability of thermal power plants has been actively researched,as power system interconnection unavoidably brings about complicated load variations.The key to improving the load following capability is the control of the fuel supply to the burner,which is provided by the coal mill.
