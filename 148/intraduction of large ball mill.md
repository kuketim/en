## Ball Mill
Very large tonnages can be ground with these ball mills because they are very effective material handling devices.Ball mills are rated by power rather than capacity.Today,the largest ball mill in operation is 8.53 m diameter and 13.41 m long with a corresponding motor power of 22 MW (Toromocho,private communications).3D Animation Demo &amp; working site of Ball Mill&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;3D Animation Demo &amp; working site of Ball Mill Henan Bailing.Loading.Unsubscribe from Henan Bailing?.video is a breif introduction of Henan Bailing Machinery Co..

## Ball Mill Crushing
Ball Mill Crushing by tube mills were first introduced into the crushing departments of cyanide plants when it was found that for crushing finer than 30 mesh other types of crushing machinery were not efficient.In order to crush with one pass,these mills were made 18 to 22 ft.(5.5 to 6.7 m.) in length.Pebbles were used as a grinding medium and the mills were lined with either …The Selection Design and Application of Mill Liners for.Introduction &gt; History is that mill liners have evolved over time &gt; Liner design has a significant effect on mill performance and liner life &gt; Engineering approaches have highlighted mill performance with mill modelling and the use of improved materials &gt; Liner design,with the advent of large diameter SAG mills,the issues of
