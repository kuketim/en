## Ball Mill Loading
Ball Mill Loading Wet Milling.Ball Mill Loading (wet milling) When charging a ball mill,ceramic lined mill,pebble mill,jar mill or laboratory jar use on a jar rolling mill it is important to have the correct amount of media and correct amount of product.High energy ball milling technique for ZnO nanoparticles …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The major use of the conventional ball milling is to fracture the particles and to reduce the size,which is different from the newly established high energy ball milling (HEBM) method.In this new method a magnet is placed close to the cell to apply a strong magnetic pulling force on the magnetic milling balls,and therefore the impact energy is much higher than the conventional ball milling.
