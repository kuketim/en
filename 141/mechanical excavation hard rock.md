## 5.Rock Excavation Tools Drilling and Excavation …
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Rock excavation tools disintegrate and remove the rock from boreholes and tunnels by four basic mechanisms: thermal spalling,fusion and vaporization,mechanical stresses,and chemical reactions,as shown in Figure 5.1.''Novel&quot; or &quot;advanced&quot; drilling tools utilize exotic systems such as …Excavation RockPrior to any excavation,rock formation is usually in a balanced (static) stress state with little or no movement,assuming no nearby seismic activities.The three principal stresses in such a static stress state are known as in situ stresses,as defined in Chapter 8,In Situ Stress,Section 8.2.
