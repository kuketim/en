## RAW MATERIALS IN CEMENT PRODUCTION
The main materials used in cement production are minerals containing calcium oxide,silex,alumina and iron oxide.These components are rarely found in one type of raw material; therefore,for the cement production the raw mix is selected for the followingCEMENT RAW MATERIALSThe raw materials used in cement manufacture are extracted in large quarries,typically with outputs of up to,or over,2.5 million tonnes per year.Typically about 1.65 tonnes of limestone (1.5 to 1.8 tonnes) and 0.4 tonnes of clay are quarried for each tonne of.

## How Cement Is Made
Common materials used to manufacture cement include limestone,shells,and chalk or marl combined with shale,clay,slate,blast furnace slag,silica sand,and iron ore.These ingredients,when heated at high temperatures form a rock like substance that is ground into the fine powder that we commonly think of as cement.Raw materials for cement manufacturingLime Component Limestone: Common forms of calcium carbonate used as raw material for cement manufacturing are limestone and chalk.Limestone is of predominantly fine grained crystalline structure,its hardness is between 1.8 to 3.0 of the Mohs scale of hardness and specific gravity 2.To 2.8.Limestone usually contains admixtures of clay substance or iron compounds,which influences its color.
