Cement Mill Overview.A cement mill is the equipment that used to grind the hard,nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement.Most cement is currently ground in ball mills.Cement clinker is usually ground using a cement ball mill.This is essentially a large rotating drum containing grinding media normally steel balls.Improvements in New3.Factors affecting ball mills Cement fineness vs.grindability Every 100 cm&#178; g increase in cement fineness increases the mill power consumption by 2 kWh t for a closed circuit mill &amp; 3 kWh t for an open circuit mill,a sheer waste if this is not required by the market! 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000
