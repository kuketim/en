## Road Aggregates CivilDigital
Man has used sand and stone for foundations for thousands of years.Significant refinement of the production and use of road aggregates occurred during the Roman Empire,which used aggregate to build its vast network of roads and aqueducts.17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The crushing test on aggregate gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate crushing under gradually applied compressive loadf the aggregate crushing value is less than 10,it signifies an exceptionally strong aggregatehereas,if the crushing value is 35 or above,it would normally be considered as weak aggregates.Concrete.Aggregate Crushing Value Test13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Sampling of Aggregates: For the Aggregate crushing value test,an aggregate sample passing through 12.5 mm IS sieve and retained on 10mm IS sieve is selected and dried to a temperature of 105 &#186;C to 110 &#186;C then cooled to room temperature.To fill the cylindrical measure mould about 6.5 kg of a sample of aggregate is sufficient.Importance Of Aggregate Mining Value Test CA 6 Aggregate,California Aggregate and Mining,Gravel Texture,Aggregate Screens,Frac Sand,Sandvik Mining Tools,Mining and Quarrying,Crushed Gravel,Sand and Gravel Mining,Aggregate Production,Aggregate Mining Impact Noise,Aggregate Company,Sandvik Mechanised Mining Equipment,Asphalt Concrete,Construction Aggregate,Terex Mining,Aggregate.

## What is the need of impact test?
The aim of aggregate impact test is to determine the relative measure of the resistance of aggregate to sudden shock or impact in which in some aggregate differs from its resistance to a slowly applies compressive load.The property of a material.Crushing test One of the model in which pavement material can fail is by crushing under compressive stress.A test is standardized by IS:2386 part IV and used to determine the crushing strength of aggregates.The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under gradually applied crushing load.Aggregate Crushing Value Test Determine Aggregate.17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Aggregate crushing value test on coarse aggregates gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate crushing under gradually applied compressive load.Coarse aggregate crushing value is the percentage by weight of the crushed material obtained when test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under standardized conditions.SIGNIFICANCE: The model developed for the relationship between aggregate crushing value (ACV) and ten percent fines aggregate crushing test (TFV) is useful in economics and safety perspective in.
