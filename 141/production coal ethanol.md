## Ethanol Can Contribute to Energy and Environmental Goals.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Relative to gasoline,ethanol produced today is much less petroleum intensive but much more natural gas and coal intensive.Production of ethanol from lignite fired biorefineries located far from where the corn is grown results in ethanol with a high coal …Annual Ethanol Production Renewable Fuels AssociationSince 1981,RFA has been the leading voice of the renewable fuels industry.We lead the industry with Action,Advocacy and Experience.

## Ethanol Production
According to a study,the ethanol production through gasification fermentation of grassroots is economically competitive in comparison with the current corn based fermentation process [160].In that work,ethanol production was estimated at approximately 20 400 L of ethanol …70 Percent More Energy Required to Make Ethanol than.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;* Adding up the energy costs of corn production and its conversion to ethanol,131,000 Btu are needed to make 1 gallon of ethanol.One gallon of ethanol has an energy value of only 77,000 Btu.&quot;Put another way,&quot; Pimentel said,&quot;about 70 percent more energy is required to produce ethanol than the energy that actually is in ethanol.
