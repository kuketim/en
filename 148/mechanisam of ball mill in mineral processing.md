## Factors Affecting Ball Mill Grinding Efficiency
The following are factors that have been investigated and applied in conventional ball milling in order to maximize grinding efficiency: a) Mill Geometry and Speed Bond (1954) observed grinding efficiency to be a function of ball mill diameter,and established empirical relationships for recommended mAMIT 135: Lesson 7 Ball Mills &amp; Circuits Mining Mill.Ball Mill Design.A survey of Australian processing plants revealed a maximum ball mill diameter of 5.24 meters and length of 8.84 meters (Morrell,1996).Autogenous mills range up to 12 meters in diameter.The length to diameter ratios in the previous table are for normal applications.For primary grinding,the ratio could vary between 1:1and.

## Mill (grinding)
Ball mills are commonly used in the manufacture of Portland cement and finer grinding stages of mineral processing,one example being the Sepro tyre drive Grinding Mill.Industrial ball mills can be as large as 8.5 m (28 ft) in diameter with a 22 MW motor,[4] drawing approximately 0.0011% of the total world's powerMineral processingThe primarily used equipment in crushing are jaw crushers,gyratory crushers and cone crushers whereas rod mills and ball mills,closed circuited with a classifier unit,are generally employed for grinding purposes in a mineral processing plant.Crushing is a dry process whereas grinding is generally performed wet and hence is more energy.
