## (PDF) Overview of Mineral Processing Methods
Ore beneficiation is a separate process that is based on the physical properties of minerals.Minerals will be more easily separated by gangue if it has a large difference in physical properties.What Is Iron Ore Beneficiation? (with pictures)&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Iron ore mining often focuses on looking for hematite deposits known as red iron ore,and magnetite,as they have naturally weak magnetic fields that aid in their purification.Hematite,however,responds better to the flotation process in iron ore beneficiation than magnetite,so it is the preferred type of ore.
