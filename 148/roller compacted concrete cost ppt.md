## Case Study Roller Compacted Concrete PDF Concrete,
Between 2 06 to 2 07,hot mix asphalt pricing rose 37% while concrete rose 6% In some areas of the country,RCC has a lower price than asphalt At the least,RCC is now very competitively priced while the net cost is lower based on lower maintenance costs involved and higher utility gained Advantages of RCC: Surface texture and uniformityConcrete Pavement Innovation &amp; Technology Transfer.10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp; 3 ROLLER COMPACTED CONCRETE IS A ZERO SLUMP CONCRETE With A Long History Of Good Performance On Heavy Duty Pavements • Concrete Pavement,Placed more efficiently • No Slump,low water content
