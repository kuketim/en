## Silicon Carbide
R.F.Davis,in Reference Module in Materials Science and Materials Engineering,2017.Introduction.Silicon carbide (SiC) is a generic name for a material produced by numerous process routes that result in a host of different external and internal microstructures and,as a consequence,a broad range of properties.Within a SiC crystal the Si and C atoms form very strong tetrahedral covalent.Silicon carbideIt occurs in nature as the extremely rare mineral moissanite.Silicon carbide powder has been mass produced since 1893 for use as an abrasive.Grains of silicon carbide can be bonded together by sintering to form very hard ceramics that are widely used in applications 3.

## Silicon metal production
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Carbon electrodes are most largely used for the production of silicon metal.The process consists in the continuous reduction of quartz (SiO2) into silicon by a reducing mixture according to the simplified relation SiO2,+ 2C &gt; Si + 2CO. very good corrosion resistance. Silicon Carbide Single Crystal Growth Silicon Epitaxial.Silicon CarbideSilicon carbide (SiC) particles are consolidated (or bonded together) by a process called sintering.Sintering is coalescence of a powder into a solid or a porous mass by heating it under pressure without melting of the powder.Silicon carbide forms an extremely hard ceramic making it useful for automotive clutches and brakes,and bulletproof.
