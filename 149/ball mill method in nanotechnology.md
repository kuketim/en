## Ball Mill Design Power Calculation
The basic parameters used in ball mill design (power calculations),rod mill or any tumbling mill sizing are; material to be ground,characteristics,Bond Work Index,bulk density,specific density,desired mill tonnage capacity DTPH,operating % solids or pulp density,feed size as F80 and maximum ‘chunk size’,product size as P80 and maximum and finally the type of circuit open closed.Overflow VS Grate Discharge Ball or Mill Why RetrofitAllow me to compare: Ball mills can be of the overflow or of the grate discharge type.Overflow discharge mills are used when a product with high specific surface is wanted,without any respect to the particle size distribution curve.Overflow discharge mills give a final product in an open circuit.
