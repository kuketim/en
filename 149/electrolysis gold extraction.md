## Processing,smelting and refining gold World Gold Council
The Miller process is rapid and simple,but it produces gold of only about 99.5 percent purity.The Wohlwill process increases purity to about 99.99 percent by electrolysis.In this process,a casting of impure gold is lowered into an electrolyte solution ofElectrolytic RefiningElectrolysis,or electrolytic refining,is a technique used for extraction,as well as purification,of metals obtained by any refining method.In the electro refining process,a block of impure metal becomes the anode,and a thin sheet of metal becomes the cathode.
