## zinc the mining process from rock to final product
Zinc mining is the process by which mineral forms of the metal zinc are extracted from the earth through mining.A zinc mine is a mine that produces zinc metal.Some mines produce primarily zinc,but some mines produce zinc as a side product of some metal that has a higher concentration in the ore.Zinc Mining,Zinc Mine,Zinc Mines,Zinc Places,ZincThe basic steps in this process include : (1) Preparation of a zinc sulfate solution by leaching zinc oxide calcines (produced by the roasting of sulfide concentrates) in dilute sulfuric acid (2) Purifiion of the resulting zinc sulfate solution,and (3) Electrolysis of the purified solution.

The cadmium content of the zinc concentrate is usually around 0.3% to 0.5%.An estimated 90% to 98% of the cadmium present in zinc ores is recovered in the mining and beneficiating stages of the extraction process.Figure 1 shows a schematic flow of mining and beneficiating a typical lead zinc ore.Figure 1.
