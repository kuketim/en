## Milling (machining)
Milling is also commonly used as a secondary process to add or refine features on parts that were manufactured using a different process.Due to the high tolerances and surface finishes that milling can offer,it is ideal for adding precision features to a part whose basic shape has already been formed.Milling Machine: Methods of Milling.Milling ProcessesMilling is an important process of manufacturing technology and basically it refers to the removal of metal from the work piece using a tool which has several cutting points and is rotating about its axis.Thus each cutting point removes a little bit of the metal but since there are multiple such points and the tool is rotating at a fast speed,the overall removal is quite brisk.You might be.
