## Recovery of Iron from Cyanide Tailings with Reduction.
Cyanide tailings have become one kind of the most hazardous solid waste.In order to recycle iron in the cyanide tailings,we present a technique using roasting water leaching magnetic separation.After analysis of the different parameters on recovery efficiency of iron,the optimum reaction parameters were proposed as the following: in reduction roasting process,weight ratios of cyanide.Recovery of Heavy Minerals by Means of Ferrosilicon …Granular ferrosilicon (Fe Si) is used as the DMS material and at the end of each operation the Fe Si is reclaimed from the process stream using a magnetic separator and is then recycled but losses of Fe Si due to attrition,adhesion to the separation products,density changes and changes to the magnetic properties can occur.
