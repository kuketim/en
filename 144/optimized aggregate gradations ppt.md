## Implementation of concrete aggregate optimization
The design process is iterative and depends on the gradations of available aggregates,the cementitious material content of the concrete mixture,and the maximum aggregate size.The procedure can be implemented using a spreadsheet and,unlike traditional approaches,is capable of blending aggregates with significantly different specific gravities.Tarantula CurveThe focus of the website started out to advance aggregate proportioning through gradation,but has turned into much more than that.Now,the focus has been to advance the knowledge of concrete materials,basic mixture design principles,and most importantly optimized graded concrete with gradation guidelines.These can be shown in the following.
