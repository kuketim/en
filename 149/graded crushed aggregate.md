## On Aggregate Grading
28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;On Aggregate Grading is good concrete performance dependent on meeting grading limits? Specifying concrete mixtures with well graded (WG) combined aggregates can be controversial.Advocates 4 argue that such mixtures have optimized packing and minimal voids and therefore minimize the cementitious paste required for a given workability.Strength and stiffness of compacted crushed concrete …A comprehensive series of drained triaxial compression tests were performed on crushed concrete aggregate (CCA) moist as compacted.When compared to ordinary natural well graded gravelly soils,the peak strength and stiffness increase more significantly with dry density,while the effect of the degree of saturation during compaction is much less significant.
