## Subaqueous Disposal in a Waste Management Facility Mine.
For subaqueous tailings emplacement,mine waste in the form of tailings slurry is piped into the pond using floating or underwater piping systems.The piping system must discharge tailings evenly across the bottom of the pond to prevent the formation of a tailings beach or the occurrence of subaqueous slides (MEND 1998,Dillon et al.2003).The.Zinc Lead Mines in Ireland: Approaches to Groundwater.planning stage.In all three cases,the potential impact of seepage from a tailings dam was an important issue,as was the proposed closure plan.Galmoy and Lisheen mines are still in the early stages of their development,and the effects of mine dewatering upon the aquifer are only beginning to be seen.Tara Mine at Navan is a mature mine.
