## Cement Analysis and Production Information …
The cement production process begins with the extraction of limestone and clay from the quarry.The material is then blended,crushed and fed to the kiln.Post kiln,the clinker is cooled and goes through a final grinding method before it is ready to ship.Control of Cement Feedstock Production.In Denmark,for example,the cement industry aims at producing a uniform cement strength at a specified age (e.g.7 and 28 days).This is accomplished by intensive quality assurance efforts in feedstock production and through close attention to fineness,size distribution,and grinding temperature during the grinding process.
