## Concrete Grade C20 Mix Ratio
Concrete Mix Design Different Grades Of.make ease in understanding we are finding the Concrete mix design of M20 grade concrete.The Concrete mix ratio for M20 grade of concrete is that mean 1 part of cement,1.5 part of sand (fine aggregate) and 3 parts of aggregate (crushed stone) in volume and then batched for mixing.What is Plum Concrete? IamcivilengineerWhereas in design It was proposed that the depth of foundation for bed would be 1.5 m.Since the foundation has to be rested on the hard strata of soil,so plum concrete of lean ratio with 80mm mm size stones would be poured which will be rammed upto 1.5 m and thereafter regular designed raft,footings may be laid.Mix Design of Plum Concrete

&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Your main issue is control over the critical things.It is easy to get the cement to all in ballast ratio correct (1:6 for C20,1:4.5 for C25).It is less easy (I presume) to get the cement to water ratio correct.The concrete though should be a &quot;dry&quot; mix.What is c25 grade concrete in psiC25 concrete is a concrete having compressive strength of 25MPa when tested at the 28th day after casting.The specimen can be cube(150x150x150) or cylindrical(125mm by 250mm high).
