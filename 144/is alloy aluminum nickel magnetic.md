Does it depend on the …It is the nickel which modifies the physical structure of the steel and makes it non magnetic.So the answer is yes,the magnetic properties of stainless steel are very dependent on the elements added into the alloy,and specifically the addition of nickel can change the structure from magnetic to non magnetic.
