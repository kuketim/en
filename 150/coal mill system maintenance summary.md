## Fire and Explosion Hazards in Cement Manufacturing.
Coal is often the main fuel source used to heat the cement kiln.Coal pulverizers are required to grind the coal from the bulk storage size to a smaller particle diameter to use in the kiln.Coal pulverizers significantly reduce the mean particle size of the coal,drastically increasing the fire explosion hazard risk.SBM LM130M complete system accomplished Vietnam coal mill.Summary： Recently,SBM vertical mill project team spread the good news that the LM130M coal mill complete system purchased by Vietnam local well known non metallic ore supply Recently,SBM vertical mill project team spread the good news that the LM130M coal mill complete system purchased by Vietnam local well known
