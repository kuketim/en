## Are the iron carbonate minerals,ankerite and ferroan.
We conclude from our data that any iron carbonate,siderite,ankerite,or ferroan dolomite,may readily oxidize in air to maghemite or hematite thus producing a spurious remanent moment (RM) that can dominate the magnetic properties of the specimen.Dolomite PowderWe offer Burnt Dolomite Powder that includes higher percentage of Mgo and Cao.The Burnt Dolomite Powder,made available by us,is the result of calcinations of Natural Dolomite Powder that consists of 50% to 55% Cac03 and 37% to 40% Mgc03.After burning,our Burnt Calcined Dolomite Powder contains 50% to 55% Calcium Oxide and 30% to 38% Magnesium.
