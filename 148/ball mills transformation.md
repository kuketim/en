## High Energy Ball Mills Instead of Planetary Ball Mills
Grinding materials to a nano scale is an important aspect of quality control and R&amp;D.AZoM speaks to Dr.Tanja Butt from RETSCH GmbH about the benefits of using High Energy Ball Mills instead of Planetary Ball Mills.High surface area corundum by mechanochemically induced.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;High purity corundum (α Al2O3) nanoparticles could enable applications such as more stable catalyst supports or precursors for high strength ceramics.Milling of corundum only produces micrometer scale particles,and direct synthesis from other aluminum oxides that would be likely starting materials,such as γ Al2O3,fails because of the high activation barrier for converting the lattice.

## What is a Ball Mill?
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;A ball mill is a grinding device that is used to turn material into fine powder.Ball mills are cylindrical in shape,and are often the grinder of choice when it comes to mashing paints,ores,ceramic materials,and certain hard chemicals.By rotating on a horizontal axis,a ball mill can effectively convert a hard material into a loose powder.Wet Ball Mill,Energy Saving Technological TransformationWet ball mill,energy saving technological transformation The wet ball mill is the ball mill key equipment for the material to be broken,and then crushed.It is widely used for grinding cement,silicate,new building materials,refractory materials,fertilizer,black and non ferrous mineral processing as well as glass,ceramics and other manufacturing industries,a variety of ores and other.

## Ball Mills
In all ore dressing and milling Operations,including flotation,cyanidation,gravity concentration,and amalgamation,the Working Principle is to crush and grind,often with rob mill &amp; ball mills,the ore in order to liberate the minerals.In the chemical and process industries,grinding is an important step in preparing raw materials fThermally Driven and Ball Milled Hematite to Magnetite.Abstract In this work,a study on the dynamics of transformation from hematite (α Fe 2 O 3) to magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) by following two solid state reaction methods is carried out.One of the procedures consists of a thermal treatment under a 20% H 2 and 80% N 2 atmosphere at 375&#176;C,whereas the second method involves a planetary ball mill to induce the transformation.
