## Types of Pavements Flexible Pavements and Rigid Pavements
Types of Pavements There are two types of pavements based on design considerations ie flexible pavement and rigid pavement Difference between flexible and rigid pavements is based on the manner in which the loads are distributed to the subgradecnkiThe permeability coefficient of the pavement material is a very important parameter in designing the drainage of pavement structure,which is also used to evaluate the quality of road construction.New equipment is used to measure the permeability coefficient of the pavement drilling core sample and the relevant testing methods are introduced.

## Introduction to pavement design
In rigid pavement,load is distributed by the slab action,and the pavement behaves like an elastic plate resting on a viscous medium (Figure 4).Rigid pavements are constructed by Portland cement concrete (PCC) and should be analyzed by plate theory instead of layer theory,assuming an elastic plate resting on viscous foundation.Dynamic response characteristics of permeable asphalt,During rainfall,asphalt pavement structure layers are often not saturated To study the dynamic response of unsaturated permeable asphalt pavement under moving load,3 D finite element models for asphalt pavements with coupling of water air force were built based on unsaturated seepage theory

## NHI 05 037 Geotech Federal Highway Administration
The AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures is the primary document used to design new and rehabilitated highway pavements The Federal Highway Administration's 1995 1997 National Pavement Design Review found that some 80 percent of states use the 1972,1986,or 1993 AASHTO Guides 2 (AASHTO,1972; 1986; 1993) Of the 35 states that.Components Of Road Pavement Structure Daily CivilComponents Of Road Pavement Structure: Following are the different components of road structure: 1 Subgrade 2 Sub base 3 Base course 4 Surface course or wearing course All these components belong to a typical flexible pavement,whereas rigid pavement usually consists of subgrade,subbase and a concrete slab 1 Subgrade: The finished and compacted surface of [,]

## Pavement Structure Pavement Interactive
A flexible pavement structure is typically composed of several layers of material each of which receives the loads from the above layer,spreads them out,then passes them on to the layer below Thus,the further down in the pavement structure a particular layer is,the less load (in terms of force per area) it must carry (see Figure 1) Figure 1Research on the Structural Design of Asphalt Pavements for,Figure 1 Drawing of pavement structure 62 Analysis of the Classification of Roadbed Strength Employing Elastic Multilayer Theory,the pavement structure of an ordinary rural road is analysed as shown in Figure 1 Depending on Ne,the road base （h =,

## Road Pavement
A road pavement structure is made of multiple layers of processed and compacted materials,in different thicknesses and in both unbound and bound forms,which together form a structure that primarily supports vehicle loads as well as providing a smooth riding quality.There are three types of pavements: • Flexible pavements,in which bituminous bound materials are placed over granular base.
