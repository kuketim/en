## Mineral processing
Mineral processing Mineral processing Concentration: Concentration involves the separation of valuable minerals from the other raw materials received from the grinding mill.In large scale operations this is accomplished by taking advantage of the different properties of the minerals to be separated.These properties can be colour (optical sorting),density (gravity separation),magnetic.Magnetic SeparationMagnetic separation takes advantage of the differences in magnetic properties of minerals.Most minerals fall into one of these categories: ferromagnetic,paramagnetic,and diamagnetic.Among these categories,ferromagnetic materials show the highest magnetic susceptibility,hence they can be easily separated by the magnetic separation method.
