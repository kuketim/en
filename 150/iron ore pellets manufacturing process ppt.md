## Pellet Plant Process
Raw material iron ore fines are fed to Iron ore grinding system (IOGS 160 t h) for grinding the ore to 85% mesh.We use the wet grinding process for this.The slurry produced is then fed to filter press.For pelletisation,we require filter cake of 8.5% to 9%.Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) Production Plantmetal iron content by directly reducing iron ore (or iron ore pellets) with reducing gases.u While the produced DRI is mainly used as the raw material of electric steelmaking,it is also used as blast furnace feed for energy saving (reduction in coke consumption
