## Concrete 411: Replacing Portland Cement with Fly Ash
Mixing fly ash,a coal burning byproduct,into concrete is a smart use of waste material,plus it offsets some of the environmental damage caused by cement manufacturing’s CO2 emissions.Subscribe to Mother Earth Living! Welcome to Mother Earth Living,the authority on green lifestyle and design.What is the function of flyash in cement?Replacement of cement with flyash in concrete is 35 % by weight for normal structures.however for special structures like dams the replacement levelscan be increased to up to 70 %.Loss of.

## Prestressed concrete
PRESTRESSED CONCRETE Prestressed concrete,invented by Eugene Frevssinet in 1928 is a method for overcoming concrete’’s natural weakness in tension.It can be used to produce beams,floors or bridges with a longer span than is practical with ordinary reinforced concrete.It can be accomplished in three ways: pre tensioned concrete,and bonded or unbonded.Concrete Mix Design with Fly Ash and SuperplasticizerResearchers have proved that concrete with approved quality fly ash does not induces corrosion of reinforcing steel even in marine and industrial aggressive environments.With proper mix design the 7 and days strength of fly ash concrete may be equal or even more than plain concrete.

## Prestressed concrete
Prestressed concrete is a form of concrete used in construction.It is substantially &quot;prestressed&quot; during production,in a manner that strengthens it against tensile forces which will exist when in service.: 3 5 This compression is produced by the tensioning of high strength &quot;tendons&quot; located within or adjacent to the concrete and is done to improve the performance of the concrete in service.Winter Weather: Optimizing the Use of Fly Ash in …Fly ash concrete is more likely to provide satisfactory scaling performance if the water cementitious materials ratio does not exceed 0.45 and the level of fly ash does not exceed about 25 percent.This,of course,assumes an adequate air void system is present in the concrete and that proper construction practices are adhered to.

## The Disadvantages of Fly Ash in Concrete Hunker
Concrete is susceptible to damage from freeze thaw cycles if it does not contain air.Tiny air bubbles can be created in concrete by using air entraining admixtures that cause the concrete to foam in the mixing and pouring stage.Fly ash reduces the amount of air.Chapter 3Although specific gravity does not directly affect concrete quality,it has value in identifying changes in other fly ash characteristics.It should be checked regularly as a quality control measure,and correlated to other characteristics of fly ash that may be fluctuating.
