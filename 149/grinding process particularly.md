## Effect of Moisture Content on the Grinding Process and.
Grinding is a staple size reduction process to produce food powders in which the powdered form is chemically and microbiologically stable and convenient to use as end products or intermediate products.The moisture content of food materials before grinding is a particularly important factor,since it determines the materials’ physical properties and the powder properties,such as flowability.Detailed view MFP 30 UNITED GRINDINGThe compact 5 axis grinder is ideal for grinding complex geometries,particularly in the case of guide and rotor blades as well as heat shields for aircraft turbines.The workpieces to be machined are loaded ergonomically directly from the front into the working space.Process optimized coolant supply.The 2 axis controlled coolant nozzle.
