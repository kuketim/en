Copper ore is an ore,which can be smelted in a furnace along with a piece of tin ore to create a bronze bar.Copper ore,along with tin ore,are the first ores a player can mine using the Mining skill,and has no requirements to mine.Mining one copper ore grants 17.5 Mining experience.After being mined,a copper ore rock takes approximately 2 seconds to respawn.Sulfur abundance and heterogeneity in the MORB mantle …Sulfur is one of the major volatile elements on the Earth and plays key roles in global S cycle processes such as core mantle differentiation,volcanic eruptions,climate change and ore deposit formation (e.g.Wallace and Edmonds,2011).

DefinitionCopper corrosion is the corrosion of materials made of copper or copper alloys.When exposed to the atmosphere,copper oxidizes,causing bright copper surfaces to tarnish.After a few years,this tarnish gradually changes to dark brown or black,and finally to green.Copper corrosion occurs at negligible rates in unpolluted air,water and

## Copper Mining and Extraction: Oxide Ores
The smelter for sulfide ores produces sulfur dioxide gas.This is scrubbed from the flue gases to make sulfuric acid for leaching copper from oxide ores.Scrubbing sulfur dioxide also protects the environment.A by product of the smelting and converting furnaces is sulfuric acid.
