## An Overview of Gallium
Gallium is present as a trace element in germanite,sphalerite,diaspore,coal,and bauxite.Although this metal occurs naturally in approximately the same amount as lead,it is extensively dissipated and not found in concentrated form in any ore.Igor Krasilovcobalt processing Uses,Supply,&amp; Facts BritannicaCobalt processing,preparation of the metal for use in various products.Below 417 C (783 F),cobalt (Co) has a stable hexagonal close packed crystal structure.At higher temperatures up to the melting point of 1,495 C (2,723 F),the stable form is face centred cubic.

The average gallium content in the earth's crust is estimated to be about 15 parts per million,roughly similar to lithium and more common than lead.The metal,however,is widely dispersed and present in few economically extractable ore bodies.How Will We Get the Gallium? Electronic DesignTechnologies gans How Will We Get the Gallium? In terms of recycling,improved recovery of Ga—considered a relatively rare substance—will depend on its demand and the ability to economically.

## Copper: How it is Sold and Priced MarketCap
Copper concentrates are produced by the beneficiation,or upgrading,of copper ore.A typical copper ore would be 0.7% to 2% copper,a typical copper concentrate would grade around 25% to 35% copper.Copper concentrates are either smelted and refined in house,or sold to custom smelters.BauxiteBauxite is a sedimentary rock with a relatively high aluminium content.It is the world's main source of aluminium and gallium.Bauxite consists mostly of the aluminium minerals gibbsite (Al(OH)3),boehmite (γ AlO(OH)) and diaspore (α AlO(OH)),mixed with the two iron oxides goethite (FeO(OH)) and haematite (Fe2O3),the aluminium clay.
