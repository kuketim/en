## Grindability
Grindability is an important factor for the characteristic of the brittle raw materials by the design the mills.As grindability depends on many unknown factors,hardgrove grindability index (HGI) is determined empirically using a sample mill,according to the following procedure.UNIT 1 HARDGROVE GRINDABILITY INDEXThe Hardgrove Grindability Index was developed as an empirical test to indicate how difficult it would be to grind a specific coal to the particle size necessary for effective combustion in a pulverized coal fired boiler.Its use has been extended to cover the preparation of pulverized coal for the cement,steel and chemical production industries.

## Standard Test Method for Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI.
1.1 This test method covers the determination of the hardgrove grindability index (HGI) of those petroleum cokes that contain no dedusting additive.The procedure for this test method is the same as in Test Method D409.Sections of this test method contain the significance and use of the HGI of petroleum coke,preliminary sample preparation procedures,and procedure and precision and bias data.Hardgrove Grindability IndexHardgrove Grindability Index (short HGI) is a measure for the grindability of coal.Grindability is an index,therefore it has no unit.The smaller the HGI,the harder is coal texture and less grindable is the coal.Grindability is an important factor for the design a coal mill.
