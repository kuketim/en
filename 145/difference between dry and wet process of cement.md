Dry mix process and wet mix process are the two methods of shotcrete construction which are based on the time at which the water is added to the mortar or Shotcrete is a type of concrete or mortar mix that is shot onto a surface at high speed.The shotcrete process can be performed in two ways,either using a dry mix or by means of a wet mix.What is the Difference Between Concrete and Gunite?It is made from mixing water,cement,sand,and usually either stone or gravel.Concrete usually contains fine and large aggregate particles.When it comes to pools,you either choose to use a dry mix process or a wet mix process.This wet mix process is often referred to as “shotcrete”.
