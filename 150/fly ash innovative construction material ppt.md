## New Construction Materials for Modern Projects
Fly ash as a mineral admixture should conform to IS: 3812.Such a material is available in the finer streams of Electro Static Precipitators fitted to the power generation system.The coarser materials are required to be processed (generally with the help of Cyclones) before being considered for use as mineral admixture for concrete.Fly ashFly ash material solidifies while suspended in the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags.Since the particles solidify rapidly while suspended in the exhaust gases,fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and range in size from 0.5 &#181;m to 300 &#181;m.The major consequence of the rapid cooling is.
