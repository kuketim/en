## Copper Ore Processing Methods
The four major steps in the production of marketable copper are mining,concentrating,smelting,and refining.In a few instances,however,leaching takes the place of concentrating,smelting,and refining.At present,although considerable leaching and direct smelting ores are produced,the bulk of the copper ore mined is concentrated.The milling of copper ores as practiced in the larger.CONFORM™ TECHNOLOGY FOR COST EFFECTIVE MANUFACTURE OF COPPER …Conform Machinery for the Manufacture of Copper Strip A typical BWE Conform line for the production of copper strip consists of the following equipment (Figure 4): • feedstock pay off • feedstock straightener • (feedstock cleaning system) • Conform machine
