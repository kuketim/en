## The Four Main Methods of Mining
The process is done by removing a strip of overburden before mining a seam of mineral.Strip mining is done only when the ore body is in close proximity to the surface.Open pit mining Open pit mining is the method in which minerals or rocks are extracted from the Earth via an open pit or borrow.Ore2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals,typically metals,that can be mined,treated and sold at a profit.Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined,often via smelting,to extract the valuable metals or minerals.The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.
