Black and brown iron oxide pigments are dry pigments and can heat stable up to 1000 degrees C temperature.Yellow iron oxide pigments can withstand temperatures up to 260 degrees C and used in coatings applications.Iron oxide pigments are available with weather and moisture resistance,relatively inert,lightfast and non toxic properties.Development of Technology for the Production of Natural.The most common inorganic pigment is red iron oxide.World production of iron oxide pigments is about 600 thousand tons per year.and greatly exceeds the production of other color pigments,with the highest demand is for red iron oxide pigments,slightly below demand for the
