## Rod mills,how they function
Rod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition,and broken and worn rods must be removed.Rod.Bar and Wire Rod Mill Steel PlantechBlock mills.Using a block mill,which drives multiple rolling mills and has been used on 100m s class wire rod lines,as the bar steel finishing mill,will achieve speeds far beyond the finishing speed of about 20m s that was the limit of conventional mills.
