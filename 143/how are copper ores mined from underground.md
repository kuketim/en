## Science Desk: How Sulfide Ore Copper Mines Pollute Save,
May 08,2015&#0183;&#32;Have you ever wondered just how sulfide ore copper mines pollute their surrounding environments? It’s a good question,because in order to understand the environmental impacts to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and Voyageurs National Park,we must first understand all of the ways sulfide ore copper mining can cause harm to the surrounding lakes,streams,wetlands and,Copper The Canadian EncyclopediaCopper ore is defined as copper mineralization that can be mined at a profit.With extremely efficient extraction and processing technologies,material grading as low as .20% copper can be mined economically.Copper sulphide ores in Canada are also a source of significant quantities of gold,silver,nickel,molybdenum,selenium and tellurium.

## 2 Mining Methods Copper
Underground mining is used when the copper ore is not near the earth's surface Miners dig a shaft into the ore deposit vertically or a horizontal tunnel (or adit) in order to do this Mining then follows the vein of ore and the underground mine develops In both mining techniques,the mined ore must be removed from the mine and transported to.
