## Kaolinite Wikipedia
Kaolinite ( ˈ k eɪ ə l ɪ n aɪ t ) is a clay mineral,part of the group of industrial minerals,with the chemical composition Al 2 Si 2 O 5 4It is a layered silicate mineral,with one tetrahedral sheet of silica (SiO 4) linked through oxygen atoms to one octahedral sheet of alumina (AlO 6) octahedra Rocks that are rich in kaolinite are known as kaolin ˈ k eɪ ə l ɪ n or china clayKaolinKaolin is an excellent ceramic raw material.Stoneware and glazes are some of the users of kaolin.Besides,most white ware and sanitary ware uses kaolin as well because kaolin is white after firing,good plasticity,has good shrinkage and strength properties.
