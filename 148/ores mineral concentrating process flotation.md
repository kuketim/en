## Mineral processing
Mineral processing Mineral processing Concentration: Concentration involves the separation of valuable minerals from the other raw materials received from the grinding mill.In large scale operations this is accomplished by taking advantage of the different properties of the minerals to be separated.These properties can be colour (optical sorting),density (gravity separation),magnetic.US1839155A235000010755 mineral Nutrition 0 descript10052799 carbon Inorganic materials 0 description 6A 13 13 Process of concentrating ores by flotation Expired Lifetime US1839155A ( en )

## Concentration of Ores: Hydraulic Washing,Froth …
Another method of concentration of ores is the Froth Flotation Method.This is the process for concentration of primarily sulphide ores.It has the advantage over gravity separation because it can collect even the extremely fine particles of minerals.The process uses the difference in the wetting characteristics of minerals and gangue.Gold Extraction and Recovery Processes25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The flotation process in general does not float free gold particles but is particularly effective when gold is associated with sulfide minerals such as pyrites.In a typical pyrytic gold ore,the gold is encapsulated within an iron sulfide crystal structure.Highly oxidized ores generally do not respond well to flotation.
