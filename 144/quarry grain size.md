6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Granite grain size: not a problem for rapid cooling of plutons.by Tas Walker..23 Yet the intrusion has a volcanic rhyolitic texture even within rock taken from inside the intrusion in a quarry.If cooling rate was the only factor affecting grain size,the inside of such a large volume of magma would cool more slowly and produce a coarser.A quastion about the grain size of Limestone?I use GRADISTAT.xls grain size analysis for marine sediments.The sieve sizes that I use are different from those given in the excel.For example the excel has 4000 then 28.
