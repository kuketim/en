## Difference Between Sag Mill vs Ball Mill
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Today we will learn about difference between sag mill vs ball mill.A mill is a machine by which solid or hard materials are broken into smaller pieces by means of grinding,crushing or cutting.This commutation is an essential part of many processes.Various kinds of mills are there with which different material processing takes place.Mining Industry: What is a grinding mill? How does it work.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Application Fields of Superfine Grinding Mill Superfine Grinding Mill used in the super fine grinding of talc,wollastonite,kaolinite,barite,mica,graphite,vermiculite,pyrophyllite,brucite,silica,aluminum hydroxide and other material,chem.

## Ball mill
The ball mill is a hollow drum closed with loading and unloading end caps,filled with grinding media and rotated around its axis.The drum of the ball mill (Pic.1) is a hollow cylinder of steel,lined inside with armor lining plates which protect it from impact and friction effects of the balls and the grinding material.HPGR High Pressure Grinding RollsHPGR or high pressure grinding rolls have made broad advances into nonferrous metal mining.The technology is now widely viewed as a primary milling alternative,and there arc a number of large installations commissioned in recent years.After these developments,an HPGR based circuit configuration would often be the base ca
