## Extracting aluminium
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Aluminium ore is called bauxite (Al 2 O 3).The bauxite is purified to yield a white powder aluminium oxide (also known as alumina ) from which aluminium can be extracted.Sarthaks eConnect Largest Online Education CommunityIn the extraction of copper from its Sulphide Ore,when ore is subjected to roasting some of it is oxidised to Cu 2 O which reacts with the remaining Cu 2 S to give copper metal.In this process,Cu 2 S behaves as reducing agent.2Cu 2 S+3O 2 +heat→2Cu 2 O(s)+2SO 2 (g).
