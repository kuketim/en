## Grinding Inconel and Need Help with Problems
Grinding Inconel and Need Help with Problems 2003.Q.I just started working for my company and ran into a problem with grinding a root form on a turbine engine blade.The material is Inconel and we are grinding this form on an Ex Cello 600 using Oil as our coolant.The problem we are having is eliminating surface white layer (over heating).Scratches from centerless grinding processI have faced similar problem while grinding low carbon steel (C&lt;0.3%) hardness range (23 28 HRc).The problem can be with grinding wheel,regulating wheel (Both generate irregular pattern of scratches) or guide plate (It generates regular pattern of scratch).Please check hardness of work piece and then select correct grinding wheel from catalog.
