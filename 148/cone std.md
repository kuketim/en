## Calculate volume and surface area of a cone
Given slant height,height and radius of a cone,we have to calculate the volume and surface area of the cone.Cone : Cone is a three dimensional geometric shape.It consists of a base having the shape of a circle and a curved side (the lateral surface) ending up in a tip called the apex or vertex.Volume of a cone :ISOIt does not cover the use of uncalibrated cone meters in pipes sized less than 50 mm or more than 500 mm,or where the pipe Reynolds numbers are below 8 &#215; 10 4 or greater than 1,2 &#215; 10 7.A cone meter is a primary device which consists of a cone shaped restriction held concentrically in the centre of the pipe with the nose of the cone upstream.

## ISO
ISO 3040:2016 specifies graphical indication applicable to a cone (right angle circular cones) to define its dimensioning or to specify its tolerancing.For the purposes of this International Standard,the term &quot;cone&quot; relates to right angle circular cones only (any intersection by a plane perpendicular to the axis of the nominal cone is a circle).std::sync::Arc12&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In the end,this means that you may need to pair Arc&lt;T&gt; with some sort of std::sync type,usually Mutex&lt;T&gt;.Breaking cycles with Weak.The downgrade method can be used to create a non owning Weak pointer.A Weak pointer can be upgraded to an Arc,but this will return None if the value stored in the allocation has already been dropped.
