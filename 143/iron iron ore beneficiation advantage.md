## Processes for Beneficiation of Iron Ores IspatGuru
Processes for Beneficiation of Iron Ores Iron is an abundant element in the earth’s crust averaging from 2 % to 3 % in sedimentary rocks to 8.5 % in basalt and gabbro.Because iron is present in many areas,it is of relatively low value and thus a deposit must have a high percentage of metal to be considered ore …Iron oreIron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron,which is one of the main raw materials to make steel—98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel.[2] In 2011 the Financial Times has speculated that iron ore is &quot;more integral to the global economy than any other commodity,except perhaps oil &quot;.

## Beneficiation of Iron Ore
Oct 26 2019 &#183; Iron ore beneficiation is a multistage process that raw iron ore undergoes to purify it prior to the process of smelting which involves melting the ore to remove the metal content The process of iron ore beneficiation has two complementary goals and these define the methods used to refine itIron Ore,Production Process of Iron Ore,Iron OreIron Ore Introduction: Ore,which contains an economical use of iron,is called an iron ore.There are many types of iron ore,magnetite (Fe3O4),hematite (Fe2O3) and (FeCO3),etc,which are mainly used for iron making.Iron ore is an important raw material for iron and steel production enterprises.
