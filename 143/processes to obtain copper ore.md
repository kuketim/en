## 5.The technology of mining and metallurgy
In copper and bauxite metallurgy,smelting the ore gives a semi finished product that has to be refined in order to obtain the pure metal.Smelting copper ore,after it has been concentrated and upgraded,produces the blister,with a metal content of 98.5% against 20% to 30% for concentrates.Extracting a metal from its ore2006 6 27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The reactions for these processes are CuCO3xCu(OH)2 + 2 H2SO4 → 2 CuSO4 + 3 H2O + CO2.All the malachite ore may not dissolve due to impurities.filter the solution to obtain and reduced copper.Allow the copper to dry and determine its mass.

## The Extraction of Copper
Extracting copper from its ores The method used to extract copper from its ores depends on the nature of the ore.Sulfide ores such as chalcopyrite (\(CuFeS 2\)) are converted to copper by a different method from silicate,carbonate or sulfate ores.Chalcopyrite.GCSE CHEMISTRY27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Extraction of Metals.Extraction of Copper.Copper is sometimes found as native metal.Copper ores include copper(II) oxide and copper(II) sulfide.Copper(II) oxide can be reduced by reaction with carbon.Some copper ores may contain only small amounts of copper.These are called low grade ores and have less than 1% copper but they are still used because copper is so valuable.

## From Ore to Finished Product
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Copper From Beginning to End.Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man.It is found in ore deposits around the world.It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago.And as alloyed in bronze (copper tin alloy) about 3000 BC,was the first engineering material known to man.Sulfide OresCopper sulfide ores must be concentrated before they can be economically transported and smelted.The universal technique for this concentration is froth flotation of finely ground ore.Froth flotation entails attaching fine Cu sulfide mineral particles to bubbles and floating them out of a water ore mixture.
