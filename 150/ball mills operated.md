## Ball Mills
Ball and pebble mills are usually operated at 70—85 % of critical speed.For dry grinding the speed is usually somewhat lower.Critical speed graph.Example : A mill with 4.5 m dia (15′) N obtained = 20 rpm.If N = 15 rpm nc obtained = 75 %.Ball Mill Lining.Ball MillIt is used in grinding materials like ores,chemicals,etc.The types of ball mills: batch ball mill and continuous ball mill with different grinding media and different design depend on the nature of the input material and the nature of the output which I need.

## Processing
The ball mills,the second stage grinding equipment,are 7.9m in diameter and 13.6m long,each with two 7800 kW motors.52 magnetic separators are used in each of the processing lines.Two concentrate thickeners,each 45m in diameter and four tails each.Ball MillsBall mills are filled up to 40% with steel balls (with 30 80 mm diameter),which effectively grind the ore.The material that is to be ground fills the voids between the balls.The tumbling balls capture the particles in ball ball or ball liner events and load them to the point
