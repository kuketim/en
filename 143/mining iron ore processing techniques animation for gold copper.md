Iron ore is the unrefined substance utilized to formulate pig iron,which is one of the most important untreated materials to compose steel.98% of the hauled out iron ore is used to produce steel.Uncontaminated iron ore is almost nameless on the exterior of the Earth apart from the combination of Fe Ni alloys from meteorites and very atypical forms of unfathomable mantle xenoliths.How is Iron Refined from Ore? (with pictures) · Although iron does not occur in its pure form in nature,some kinds of ore contain up to 70% iron atoms.Iron ore consists of oxygen and iron atoms bonded together into molecules.To create pure iron,one must deoxygenate the ore,leaving only iron atoms behind,which is the essence of the refining process.
