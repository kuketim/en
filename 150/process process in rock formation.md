## Rock Cycle Process Sciencing
The process of rock formation takes place within the context of the rock cycle,which tracks the origin of igneous,sedimentary and metamorphic rocks and the relationships between those three basic categories.The rock cycle is often a series of steps,but it can take different pathways.soil formation process.soil formation process : ：0.474.from basalt parent material the contents of most micro elements are obviously affected and controlled by the parent rock.

## Earth Science for Kids: Rocks,Rock Cycle,and Formation
Earth Science.Rocks and the Rock Cycle.What is a rock? A rock is a solid made up of a bunch of different minerals.Rocks are generally not uniform or made up of exact structures that can be described by scientific formulas.Scientists generally classify rocks by how they were made or formed.There are three major types of rocks: Metamorphic.Sedimentary Rock FormationSedimentary rock formation begins with igneous,metamorphic,or other sedimentary rocks.When these rocks are exposed at the earth’s surface they begin the long slow but relentless process of becoming sedimentary rock.All rocks are subject to weathering.Weathering is anything that breaks the rocks into smaller pieces or sediments.

## Formation
for&#183;ma&#183;tion (f&#244;r mā′shən) n.1.The act or process of forming something or of taking form.2.Something formed: beautiful cloud formations.3.The manner or style in which something is formed; structure: the distinctive formation of the human eye.4.A specified arrangement or deployment,as of aircraft,troops,or players on a sports team.5.Gem Formation: How are Gemstones Created?Most gems form naturally as minerals within the Earth.Most form as crystals,solids whose atoms are arranged in highly ordered repeating patterns called crystal systems.Learning about mineral crystallization and the geological processes involved in gem formation will help gemologists understand some of the properties they’ll encounter in gemstones.
