## Characterization of fly ash from low sulfur and high.
Fly ash samples were collected in November and December of 1994,from generating units at a Kentucky power station using high and low sulfur feed coals.The samples are part of a two year study of the coal and coal combustion byproducts from the power station.The ashes were wet screened at 100,200,325,and 500 mesh (150,75,42,and 25 ??m,respectively).Fly ashFly ash or flue ash,also known as pulverised fuel ash in the United Kingdom,is a coal combustion product that is composed of the particulates (fine particles of burned fuel) that are driven out of coal fired boilers together

## A clean process for alumina extraction and ferrosilicon.
Coal fly ash (CFA) is a kind of solid waste,which is mainly derived from thermal power plants (Valeev et al.2019).The amount of the CFA produced in 2015 was approximately 620 million tons (Luo et al.2019,Mushtaq et al.2019).With the increasing demand of electric power,the CFA emission burden will further increase.
