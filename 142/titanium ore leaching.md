## extraction of titanium
Titanium can't be extracted by reducing the ore using carbon as a cheap reducing agent.The problem is that titanium forms a carbide,TiC,if it is heated with carbon,so you don't get the pure metal that you need.The presence of the carbide makes the metalTitanium Geoscience AustraliaTitanium is a lightweight,strong and rust resistant silver white metal.Pure titanium is quite soft but titanium alloys are extremely strong (even stronger than steel and aluminium).Titanium has a very high melting point and is non toxic.Titanium dioxide is one of the.
