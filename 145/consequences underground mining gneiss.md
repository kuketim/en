## Problems in the mining industry in South africa
The current turbulence in the mining industry in South Africa has its roots in several different factors.First,the fall in global demand for platinum and other minerals due to recession; second,the consequences of the Marikana disaster in destabilising labour relations; and third,the structural character of our mining industry.A great deal has been written about the first two factors,so.Selective Blast Mining™ of narrow reef ore bodies.Selective Blast Mining™ of narrow reef ore bodies (English).environmental regulations and consequences for tunnel blasting projects in urban areas in Sweden.Jonson.Perimeter blasting in a 130 m road cut in gneiss with holes with radial bottom slots.Ouchterlony,F.
