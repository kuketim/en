## How to Select the Right Primary Crusher
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;This step may lead to subtle changes in crusher recommendation.For instance,based on simulated results,it may make sense to forego a portable jaw crusher for a stationary model.After simulation,the next step in the crusher selection process is to visually carry the selection through to other components of the plant via a concept drawing.jaw stone crushersJaw crusher is a simulated animal's chin movement to destroy the material.It is often used as a coarse crusher for all kinds of stone production lines.For large stone,jaw crusher can also be used as a second stage crusher,two jaw crushers can become jaw crusher plant,increase the crushing effect.

## Choosing the right primary crusher for your aggregate.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;This step may lead to subtle changes in crusher recommendation.For instance,based on simulated results,it may make sense to forego a portable jaw crusher for a stationary model.After simulation,the next step in ensuring crusher fit is to visually carry the selection through to other components of the plant via a concept drawing.Liner wear in jaw crushersJaw and cone crushers are commonly used in the mining and aggregates industry.Today,it is possible to predict the performance of a cone crusher,provided the geometry,crusher settings and the characteristics of the material fed into the crusher are known (Evertsson,2000).The geometry of the crusher will change because of wear.

## Crusher
The Blake crusher was patented by Eli Whitney Blake in 1858.The Blake type jaw crusher has a fixed feed area and a variable discharge area.Blake crushers are of two types single toggle and double toggle jaw crushers.In the single toggle jaw crushers,the swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft which leads to a much more compact design.New primary crusher in proven steel frame structure.Clear favourite was ultimately a modular designed Metso jaw crusher of the type Nordberg C125.By lucky coincidence,this was spontaneously available as a new machine and could be easily integrated into the existing steel structure,after the integration had been simulated with a template.Alternative solutions were therefore ruled out.
