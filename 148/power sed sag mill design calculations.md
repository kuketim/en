## Grinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process Control
The design of a ball mill can vary significantly depending on the size,the equipment used to load the starting material (feeders),and the system for discharging the output product The size of a mill is usually characterized by the ratio “length to diameter” and this ratio most frequently varies from 05 to 35 TheA Mechatronic Solution Design and Experience with Large,Figure 2: Principle arrangement of SAG mill drive (mechanical part) Design Process In the beginning of Gearless Drives in the,compared to today’s large high power mills Mechanical design calculations were based on static load cases in terms of forces and acceleration loads The simulation models
