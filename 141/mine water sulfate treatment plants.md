## Acid mine drainage
Acid mine drainage,acid and metalliferous drainage (AMD),or acid rock drainage (ARD) is the outflow of acidic water from metal mines or coal mines.Acid rock drainage occurs naturally within some environments as part of the rock weathering process but is exacerbated by large scale earth disturbances characteristic of mining and other large.ENNTECMine drainage,process water and storm water associated with industrial activities are the main types of water produced in mining operation.The two primary aims of the treatment of contaminated mine water are to neutralize acidity and removal metals.
