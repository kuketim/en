## Iron and Manganese Filters for Well Water
ProOX media is a solid manganese dioxide media,whereas most iron filter media use a thin coating of manganese dioxide over some other type of filter media.The solid manganese dioxide is the gold standard for iron filtration media,as the media lasts for many years,often 15 to 20 years and these systems can filter the water at a faster rate.RadiumRadium is a chemical element with the symbol Ra and atomic number 88.It is the sixth element in group 2 of the periodic table,also known as the alkaline earth metals.Pure radium is silvery white,but it readily reacts with nitrogen (rather than oxygen) on exposure to air,forming a black surface layer of radium nitride (Ra3N2).All isotopes.
