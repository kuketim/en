## Grinding Circuit
7.5.2 Circuit Operation.Grinding circuits are fed at a controlled rate from the stockpile or bins holding the crusher plant product.There may be a number of grinding circuits in parallel,each circuit taking a definite fraction of the feed.An example is the Highland Valley Cu Mo plant with five parallel grinding lines (Chapter 12).Parallel.Grinding Circuit Control 2014• PBM SBM (2 staged) Circuit.Result: 72% reduction in mill feed rate; 58% reduction in rougher feed density; &amp; 47% reduction in rougher feed flow.away from the optimum limit to compensate for this.Bring your grinding circuit to the next level with a grinding control strategy which is applied consistently.
