## Chapter 1
Fly ash consists primarily of oxides of silicon,aluminum iron and calcium.Magnesium,potassium,sodium,titanium,and sulfur are also present to a lesser degree.When used as a mineral admixture in concrete,fly ash is classified as either Class C or Class F ash based on its chemical composition.What Is Fly Ash Cement? (with pictures)&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Fly ash cement is a primary ingredient in certain concretes that is often used as an alternative to Portland cement,which is a more traditional concrete base.The ash itself is a byproduct of coal combustion,but once formed into a cement the ash usually binds in such a way as to neutralize many of the chemicals and toxins that have made coal burning so controversial in recent years.

## Chapter 3
Because fly ash addition contributes to the total cementitious material available in a mix,the minimum cement factor (portland cement) used in the PCC can be effectively reduced for FAC.The ACI acknowledges this contribution and recommends that a water (cement plus pozzolan) ratio be used for FAC in lieu of the conventional water cement ratio used in PCC.Coal Fly AshFly ash has been successfully used as a mineral admixture in PCC for nearly 60 years.This is the largest single use of fly ash.It can also be used as a feed material for producing Portland cement and as a component of a Portland pozzolan blended cement.

All fly ashes exhibit cementitious properties to varying degrees depending on the chemical and physical properties of both the fly ash and cement.Compared to cement and water,the chemical reaction between fly ash and calcium hydroxide typically is slower resulting in delayed hardening of the concrete.High strength concrete properties,admixture,and mix …Admixture in High strength concrete A part of cement (5 to 8 percent) can also be replaced by silica fume.As silica fume particles are very fine (less than one hundredth of cement particles),they fill nano scale voids in concrete.It can also convert calcium.

## Uses,Benefits,and Drawbacks of Fly Ash in Construction
Fly Ash is a coal waste products that acts a lot like cement in the right recipe.When you burn massive amounts of pulverized coal,one of the waste products is an ash that acts a lot like cement in the right recipe.That makes for a great relationship between coal fired power plants and ready mix concrete producers who use fly ash as an admixture.Chapter 3Fly ash is used to lower the cost and to improve the performance of PCC.Typically,15 percent to 30 percent of the portland cement is replaced with fly ash,with even higher percentages used for mass concrete placements.An equivalent or greater weight of fly ash is substituted for the cement removed.
