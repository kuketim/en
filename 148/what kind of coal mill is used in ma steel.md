## Ball mill
The ball mill can grind various ores and other materials either wet or dry.There are two kinds of ball mill,grate type and overfall type due to different ways of discharging material.Many types of grinding media are suitable for use in a ball mill,each material having its own specific properties and advantages.Ball MillsTypes of Mill Discharge.Steel Head Ball Rod Mills are available in any one of five different types of discharge: Overflow,perforated overflow,return spiral,grate,and; peripheral.To best serve your needs,the Trunnion can be furnished with small (standard),medium,or large diameter o

## Energy Use in US Steel Manufacturing
While early steel manufacturing was predominantly coal powered,modern approaches to steel making have seen a rise in natural gas and electric powered furnaces.Still,coal and coke are significant sources of energy in steel production.On this page,I examine the energy usage in US Steel production.Improving Coal Pulverizer Performance and ReliabilityThe four most common types of coal pulverizers are: Ball Tube Mills This type of mill consists of a rotating tube filled with cast alloy balls.Coal is introduced through two hollow trunnions on each side of the tube.As the tube ro
