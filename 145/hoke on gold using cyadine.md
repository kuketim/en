Cyanide gas is most dangerous in enclosed places where the gas will be trapped Cyanide gas evaporates and disperses quickly in open spaces,making it less harmful outdoors Cyanide gas is less dense than air; so it will rise Cyanide prevents the cells of the body from using oxygen When this happens,the cells dieExtraction of gold using cyanide24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Extraction of gold using cyanide Gold is found in very low concentrations in the ore from which it is mined.To collect the gold from the ore it needs to be separated from the other minerals in the ore.To do this the gold needs to be made into a soluble form so that it can be separated from the other minerals as gold is insoluble.
