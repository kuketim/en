## Concrete Mix Design Procedure and Example IS456
Concrete mix design is the process of finding the proportions of concrete mix in terms of ratios of cement,sand and coarse aggregates.For e.g.a concrete mix of proportions 1:2:4 means that cement,fine and coarse aggregate are in the ratio 1:2:4 or the mix contains one part of cement,two parts of fine aggregate and four parts of coarse aggregate.Basic Chemistry help?

## Cement composition and classification
Proportioning of materials.Portland cements can be modified easily,depending on the raw materials used and the process used to combine them.Proportioning of the raw materials is based on a series of simultaneous calculations that take into consideration the chemical composition of the raw materials and the type of cement to be produced: American Society for …What is meant by ratio in mixture of 1:2:4 in concrete.Concrete is a mixture of cement and sand and aggregate.The ratio is the volumes of each component.1:2:4 is therefore the concrete resulting when 1 metre cubed of cement is mixed
