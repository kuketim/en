Us Bauxite is a raw material used primarily in the production of aluminiumThe bauxite ore is refined into alumina before being smelted into aluminium Australia is known for its high grade ore,especially in the Weipa and Gove deposits The quality of bauxite ore is determined by its available alumina (Al 2 O 3) contentThe presence of impurities,which make the ore more,bauxite&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The deal will also see Australian Bauxite supply chemical grade bauxite to Aziz Group for the manufacture of polyaluminum chloride to be used in the treatment of industrial waste water.&quot;There is a real opportunity for our well established trading and manufacturing relationships to be of significant support in the marketing of this specialised Australian Bauxite cement grade bauxite.

## Bauxite Types and Uses
Bauxite is aluminium rich ore that is used for aluminium production (the metallurgical bauxites) and for production of refractory materials,chemicals or cements (the non metallurgical bauxites).Metallurgical bauxites are sub divided into two basic types based on the processing methods that must be applied to them at the alumina refinery stage.What are the important uses of bauxite? What are some,Answer (1 of 3): Bauxite is used in a lot of industries like the chemical industry,refractory,abrasive,cement,steel,and petrol industry amongst others In chemical,bauxite along with alumina is used in the manufacturing of aluminium chemicals In refractory,it,
