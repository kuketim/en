## Investigating use of dimensional limestone slurry …
Sustainable disposal of these wastes has emerged as a big challenge around the globe.The present research focusses on minimizing the environmental pollution which is often due to unplanned disposal of slurry waste generated during the cutting process.Characterization of Dimension Stone Sawing Sludge …Dimension stone sludge (referred to as marble sludge,granite sludge or slurry) is generated as a by product during the sawing of the stone blocks.In this process,water is used as a coolant and the powdered rock produced as a result of the friction and movement of the saw blade within the block is removed with the cooling water.
