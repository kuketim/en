## Water Reducing Admixtures For Concrete
Most of water reducing admixtures belong to anionic surfactants,such as sodium lignosulphonate,sodium naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde,polycarboxylate superplasticizer,etc.After adding the concrete mixture,they have a dispersion effect on the cement particles,which can improve its workability,reduce the unit water consumption,improve the fluidity of the concrete mixture,or reduce.Chemical AdmixturesConsequently,concrete containing a water reducing admixture needs less water to reach a required slump than untreated concrete.The treated concrete can have a lower water cement ratio.This usually indicates that a higher strength concrete can be produced without increasing the amount of cement.
