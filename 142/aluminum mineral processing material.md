## Mineral processing metallurgy Britannica
Mineral processing,art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock,or gangue.It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy.The primary operations are comminution and concentration,but there are other important operations.Alumina Refining The Aluminum AssociationThe aluminum hydroxide seeds stimulate the precipitation of solid aluminum hydroxide crystals.The aluminum hydroxide settles at the bottom of the tank and is removed.Finally,the aluminum hydroxide is washed of any remaining caustic soda and heated to remove excess water.After this process,alumina (aluminum oxide) emerges as a fine white.
