## Extraction and Recovery of Cerium from Rare Earth …
Rare earth elements are widely found in many minerals,some of which,such as bastnaesite,monazite,and xenotime,are of great commercial value.Cerium (Ce) is the rare earth element with the highest content in light rare earth ore.Solvent extraction is the most effective and efficient method to recover and separate Ce from other light rare earth elements.After acid leaching of rare earth.Mineral Separation and Characterization of the Ilmenite.9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;3.1.Tuning method for mineral separation After an exhaustive literature review,the authors don not find a specific technique and methodology to isolate each mineral phases in the ilmenite ore.In general the papers present a wide range of adjustment parameters among the methods,but the most efficient technique is the magnetic separation [18,19].
