## Impact Crusher Description Advantages Types
In normal types of crusher pressure is generated for the crushing of rocks.But,impact crushers involve an impact method.Impact crusher is further divided.Impact CrushersImpact Crushers create material reduction by providing a sudden impact force that causes the material to shatter along all the weakest fissures in the stone.Controlling the flow of the material through the Impact Crusher requires features that vary from one style of impactor to another,and this is what separates McLanahan from the other manufacturers.
