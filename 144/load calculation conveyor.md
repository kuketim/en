The required take up length is calculated as follows,where S Sp = take up length (m) L = conveyor length (m) ε = belt elongation,elastic and permanent (%) As a rough guideline,use 1,5 % elongation for textile belts and 0,2 % for steel cord belts.Note: For longLoad Torque Required for Driving a Belt Conveyor Nidec CorporationThis is Nidec&#39;s technical calculation service page.You can easily obtain the calculation result of the load torque when driving a belt conveyor simply by entering the values.
