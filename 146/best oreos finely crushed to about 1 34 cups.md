## Cookies and Cream Puppy Chow
14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Story: Okay,I had 6 boxes of Rice Chex sitting on top of my fridge.What's a girl to do? Make a lot of muddy buddies,right? Yes.So me and my fabulous new roommate made 4 different types of muddy buddies puppy chow this weekend.But I figure,the Super Bowl is coming up and everyone needs some sugary snacks next to the chips and dip.And let's face it,cupcakes just aren't very manly.16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Add the 2 cups of the powdered sugar,beating again until combined.Beat in the remaining powdered sugar,vanilla,and salt.Then add just enough heavy cream or milk to help the frosting get to a nice pipeable consistency.Stir in the crushed Oreos and then use this frosting to frost cake or cupcakes.Oreo Frosting Recipe: The Best Oreo Buttercream16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Add in 1 cup of crushed Oreos,and mix on low until the ingredients are fully incorporated,and the desired consistency is reached.If the frosting is too thick,add in additional cream (1 tablespoon at a time).If the frosting is too thin,add in more powdered sugar (1 4 at a time).29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;For example,if you need 1 cup (100 g) of crushed Oreos,place 1 cup (or about 12 whole cookies) of whole Oreos in the food processor.Depending on how much crushed Oreos you'll need,you may need to crush the cookies in batches so they'll fit in your food processor.
