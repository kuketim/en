## Objective Of Aggregate Crushing Value Test
Crushing value apparatus (ACV),Aggregates testing.The aggregate crushing value (ACV) provides relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load.Two versions available: 150 (standard) and 75 mm dia.Bulk DensityBulk Density Measurement Key points.Bulk density is the weight of soil in a given volume.Soils with a bulk density higher than 1.6 g cm3 tend to restrict root growth.Bulk density increases with compaction and tends to increase with depth.Sandy soils are more prone to high bulk density.
