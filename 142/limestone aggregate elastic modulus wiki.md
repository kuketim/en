## The effects of limestone aggregate on concrete …
The strength and modulus of elasticity in concrete increase with the increase in fine limestone aggregate.This increment is relatively small,but test results show that limestone makes the concrete stronger and more elastic.Hydraulic limeHydraulic lime is a useful building material for the following reasons: It has a low elastic modulus.There is no need for expansion (movement) joints.It allows buildings to &quot;breathe&quot;,and does not trap moisture in the walls.It has a lower firing temperature than Portland cement,and thus consumes less energy.
