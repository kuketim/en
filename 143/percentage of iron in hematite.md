## Iron Element: (Information + Properties + Fun Facts)
Iron is one of the abundant metal on the earth.But due to its reactive nature,it can easily get rusted and reacts with other elements to form different compounds.Most iron that is found in the crust is found in the minerals of iron oxide,which are magnetite and hematite.of iron oxide,which are magnetite and hematite.Froth Flotation of Iron Ores sapub2017121&ensp&#0183&enspWith the depleting reserves of highgrade iron ore in the world,froth flotation has become increasingly important to process intermediate and lowgrade iron ore in an attempt to meet the rapidly growing demand on the international market.In over half a century's practice in the iron ore industry,froth flotation has been established as an efficient method to remove impurities from iron ore.

## Iron and steel
Different ores contain different amounts of iron.Hematite and magnetite have about 70 percent iron,limonite has about 60 percent,pyrite and siderite have 50 percent,while taconite has only 30 percent.Using a combination of both deep mining (under the ground) and opencast mining (on the surface),the world produces approximately 1000.Iron processing Ores BritannicaPure magnetite contains 72.4 percent iron,hematite 69.9 percent,limonite 59.8 percent,and siderite 48.2 percent,but,since these minerals never occur alone,the metal content of real ores is lower.Deposits with less than 30 percent iron are commercially unattractive,and,although some ores contain as much as 66 percent iron,there are.

## Hematite Wikipedia
Hematite,also spelled as haematite,is a common iron oxide with a formula of Fe 2 O 3 and is widespread in rocks and soils.Hematite forms in the shape of crystals through the rhombohedral lattice system,and it has the same crystal structure as ilmenite and corundum.Hematite and ilmenite form a complete solid solution at temperatures above 950 °C (1,740 °F).A sample of an ore of iron,hematite,is 70% Fe2O3.How.A sample of hematite Fe2O3 has the mass 4.83 x 10 3 kg.a.how much iron (kg) can be extracted from this sample of hematite? b.what is the percentage of iron in this ore? asked by Jillian on April 12,2013; Chemistry.Iron ores have different amounts of iron per kilogram of ore.

## Hematite University of Wisconsin Madison
Hematite Mineral Description.Hematite is an iron oxide mineral of the Oxides and Hydroxides group,with structural formula [alpha Fe 2 O 3].The structure is similar to that of corundum,and consists essentially of a dense arrangement of Fe 3+ ions in octahedral coordination with oxygens in hexagonal closest packing.The structure can also be described as the stacking of sheets of octahedraly.How to calculate the percentage of iron in FeO,…Easily.I’ll calculate one for you,and request you to practice the other two.And many other compounds.FeO = 1 atom iron(Fe),1 atom oxygen(O).Molecular mass of FeO = Fe + O = 56 + 16 = 72 u.Mass of iron (Fe) in the molecule = 56 u.% of Fe =.
