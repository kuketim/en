## Cutting and Grinding Tools for Welding
You can use this process to cut metal,gouge out defective metal or bad welds,or to bevel a groove for welding.(You'll probably have to do some grinding and other clean up afterward.) The cuts made are generally not as precise and pretty as plasma cutting,but the cost is far cheaper.“Improvement of mechanical strengths by the use of grinding aids: …The grinding process of cement absorbs 60 70 % of the total energy employed.Finish grinding accounts for about 38% of specif ic electric power consumption [2 ].The quantity of energy req uired by the process to obtain the correct fineness is only partially
