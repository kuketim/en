The grinding process reduces the rock to a slurry.The SAG mill is a large revolving cylinder.Rock is ground by the turning action of the mill,and impact from the hardened steel balls and the rock itself.In order to ensure that the rock is ground finely enough the SAG mill has a trommel screen (5),which acts like a large sieve.The 6 Steps To Modern Steel Production ExplainedModern day steel production makes use of both traditional raw materials (iron) and recycled materials to turn them into steel.With this in mind,here are the 6 steps to modern steel production explained.Step 1 The iron making process.As iron is the main component of steel it firstly needs to be made.
