Copper concentrate is fed into the ISASMELT furnace,where it is heated to 1185 degrees Celsius.This process melts the concentrate into liquid,drawing out impurities and releasing sulfur dioxide gas,which is captured and piped to the Incitec Pivot Acid Plant adjacent to our smelter stack for conversion into sulphuric acid,used in crop fertilisers.proccess preserve copper from gold miningproccess preserve copper from gold mining ; Hardrock Mining Techniques Underground,Underground hard rock mining refers to various underground mining techniques used to excavate hard minerals such as those containing metals like gold,copper,zinc,nickel and lead or gems such as diamonds.gold copper mining process Mineral Processing EPC.
