The coal vertical mill is driven by an electric motor and driven by the planetary reducer to rotate the mill disc of the coal mill.The 2 4 rollers on the mill disc rotate under the drive of the mill disc.The raw coal coming in through the coal falling pipe is distributed on the mill disc.Small particles of coal are crushed by the relative motion of roller and disc.When the raw coal is ground.Vertical roller millVertical roller mills are widely used in the concrete and mining fields,and are also used to process coal，lime and gypsum.These units can process both raw and recycled materials,while helping to reduce waste and preserve virgin supplies of these materials.Capacity: 250 t

## A Comparison of Three Types of Coal Pulverizers
Vertical Roller Mill The vertical roller mill (VRM) shown in Figure 4 is an air swept,medium speed,vertical pulverizer with integral classifier.It pulverizes coal by applying hydraulically loaded grinding pressure through three grin ding rollers onto a rotating bed of coal.Grinding pressure can be adjusted to account for variations in coalRAYMOND&#174; ROLLER MILLSMajor factors affecting the capacity of a roller mill include desired fineness,grindability and initial moisture.• Mill capacity decreases when product fineness increases.• The harder a material is to grind,the lower the capacity.• High initial moisture may also decrease capacity because of drying limitations of the mill.
