## 11 Ways to Locate Part Zero on Your CNC Machine.
11 Ways to Locate Part Zero on Your CNC Machine.This article was originally published in 2016 with only 8 ways to locate Part Zero and has been hugely popular ever since.I’ve updated it with several new methods.One of the first things you have to do before you can begin machining a part is to tell the machine where part zero is.Top 8 Milling Tools for New CNC MachinistsCNC machines,which have a higher rigidity and are significantly less prone to backlash,will use a Climb Milling process where the tool advances through a material from maximum to minimum thickness.This cutting process allows the heat to leave the cut with the chip,reducing heat generation and tool wear while producing a better surface.

## Milling Process,Defects,Equipment
End milling An end mill makes either peripheral or slot cuts,determined by the step over distance,across the workpiece in order to machine a specified feature,such as a profile,slot,pocket,or even a complex surface contour.The depth of the feature may be machined in a single pass or may be reached by machining at a smaller axial depth of cut and making multiple passes.MACHINING OPERATIONS AND MACHINE TOOLS&#169;2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons,Inc.M.P.Groover,“Fundamentals of Modern Manufacturing 2 e” Machining Operations and Part Geometry Each machining operation produces a characteristic part geometry due to two factors: 1.Relative motions between the tool and the
