## Centerless Grinding: Understanding The Basic …
The grinding wheel,which is responsible for the grinding process itself,consists of many abrasive cutting grains on its surface,which grind the bar material until it reaches perfect roundness.During the process,the grinding wheel loses some of the abrasive grains,so it must be constantly dressed with new cutting grains to achieve the perfect shape and surface every time.Basics of centerless grinding Cutting Tool EngineeringDual grinding machines deliver a two step process that combines centerless grinding with grinding between centers,alleviating concentricity concerns.In the Zone Regardless of machine design,the workpiece is guided by its outer surface during centerless grinding.
