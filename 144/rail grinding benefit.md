## Rail transport
Rail transport (also known as train transport) is a means of transferring passengers and goods on wheeled vehicles running on rails,which are located on tracks.In contrast to road transport,where vehicles run on a prepared flat surface,rail vehicles (rolling stock) are directionally guided by the tracks on which they run.Tracks usually consist of steel rails,installed on ties (sleepers.RAIL GRINDING TO BENEFIT LOCAL LINESMEDIA RELEASE RAIL GRINDING TO BENEFIT LOCAL LINES The vital rail link between Marulan,Moss Vale and Aylmerton will benefit from rail grinding scheduled to take place over the next few weeks.Between the 18th of October and the 26th of October Australian Rail Track.

&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Thus years ago,grinding of the rail surface used to be undertaken to remove corrugations and ensure a smoother ride.The advent of harder steels in the rail manufacturing process made this less important,such that in the UK towards the end of the 1990s grinding had virtually ceased altogether.Modelling and Analysis of Rail GrindingModelling and Analysis of Rail Grinding &amp; Lubrication Strategies for Controlling Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) and Rail Wear by Venkatarami Reddy Master of Information Technology (QUT) Bachelors in Business Management Thesis Submitted for the Degree of
