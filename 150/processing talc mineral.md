## Processing Aid
Golcha Minerals talc as processing aid! Golcha Minerals talc enhances the function ability along with systematizing the mechanical properties of the product.It also lowers the cost of the compound.Other than this,the talc is highly a lamellar mineral.This actually results in facilitating a proper slippage in between two platelets.In context to rubber production and manufacturing,our talc.talc processing lineTalc is one of the most important industrial minerals.Talc is a common metamorphic mineral in metamorphic belts which contain ultramafic rocks,such as soapstone (a high talc rock),and within whiteschist and blueschist metamorphic terranes.

## Talc Imerys
Talc is a hydrated magnesium silicate.There are many types of talc and each ore body has its own features,its own geology,formed many millions of years ago.As a natural ore,talc is always found in combination with at least one other mineral.The most common of these is chlorite,a chemically and structurally similar ore.effect of the talc filler content on the2012122&ensp&#0183&enspTalc is a phyllosilie mineral with a trioctahedral layered structure [Mg3Si4O10(OH)2].The idealized crystal structure contains a layered structure of a sandwich of magnesium oxide (brucite like) octahedra between tetrahedra of silica.6 This leads to a neutrally charged system with all vacancies satis?ed and with no net surface charge.
