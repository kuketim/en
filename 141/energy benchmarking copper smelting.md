## Copper slag
Copper slag is a by product of copper extraction by smelting.During smelting,impurities become slag which floats on the molten metal.Slag that is quenched in water produces angular granules which are disposed of as waste or utilized as discussed below.Copper extractionCopper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes.Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source,local environmental regulations,and other factors.As in all mining operations,the ore must usually be.
