The extraction of gold from ores and electronic waste is an important topic worldwide,as this precious metal has immense value in a variety of fields.However,serious environmental pollution and high energy consumption due to the use of toxic oxidation reagents and harsh reaction conditions is a well‐known problem in the gold industry.Photos of gold ores,quartz,telluride gold ore and …22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The fourth class of gold ores comprises the gold telluride group.The gold telluride ores occur with silver,or with silver,lead and antimony,or as native gold accompanied by other tellurides.These ores are often sent direct to the smelters for treatment.A fifth type is the disseminated ore type.They are often low in grade but large.

## Gold Ore
Gold ores are classified “free milling” and “refractory” based on their response to cyanide dissolution.Bioprocessing can be used to treat refractory gold bearing sulfide ores as well as carbonaceous gold ores.It is essential to characterize different types of gold ores to understand the extent and nature of gold entrapment in different associated mineral phases before an appropriate.Flotation of gold and gold bearing oresRefractory gold ores commonly contain free gold,sub microscopic gold,carbonaceous material,base metals,pyrite,marcasite,arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite (Swash,1988).Clays and graphitic carbon are the most troublesome accessory components in some of these ores,as far as gold …

## Characterization of Gold Ores The Basis of Gold.
Our project it is a joint initiative between Metalor (Switzerland),the worldwide most important refiner of gold,and Universities of Lausanne and Geneva,with support from Innosuisse.We address a crucial aspect of the gold value chain: the traceability of primary gold.The most important ore of aluminum is?The most important ore of aluminum is Bauxite ([math]Al 2O 3*2H 2O[ math]).It is the worlds primary source of aluminum.Other ores of aluminum is as follows: Corundum [math]Al 2O 3[ math] Felspar [math]KAlSi 3O 8[ math] Cryolite [math]Na 3A.

## Flotation of Gold and Gold Bearing Ores
The processing characteristics of copper gold ores vary from ore to ore and are closely related to the mineralogical composition of the ore.Based on composition,the ores can be classified into porphyry copper gold ores containing pyrite,porphyry copper gold ores with negligible pyrite content,and altered supergene copper gold ores.Photos of gold ores,quartz,telluride gold ore and …2014 6 22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The fourth class of gold ores comprises the gold telluride group.The gold telluride ores occur with silver,or with silver,lead and antimony,or as native gold accompanied by other tellurides.These ores are often sent direct to the smelters for treatment.A fifth type is the disseminated ore type.They are often low in grade but large.
