## 23.3: Metallurgy of Iron and Steel
Cast iron has already been mentioned above.This section deals with the types of iron and steel which are produced as a result of the steel making process.Wrought iron: If all the carbon is removed from the iron to give high purity iron,it is known as wrought iron.Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An OverviewThe iron ore pelletizing process consists of three main steps: 1 Pelletizing feed preparation and mixing: the raw material (iron ore concentrate,additives anthracite,dolomite and binders are prepared in terms of particle size and chemical specifications,dosed,and mixed together to feed the pelletizing process; 2

## The Making of Iron & Steel SEAISI
Iron ore,as mined,is a combination of iron with oxygen and various other unwanted substances,generally known as "gangue" The first metallurgical step is to reduce iron ore to metallic iron,a process which is mostly carried out in a blast furnace,using coke as both a fuel and reducing agentThe Making of Iron &amp; Steel4 2 Materials Used to make Steel 2.1 Iron Ore Composition Iron very rarely occurs in the earth's surface as a metal.It is widely distributed,combined with oxygen as iron oxides.In fact it is believed that iron makes up about 5% by weight of the earth's crust.
