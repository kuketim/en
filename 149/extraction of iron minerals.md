## Extraction of Metals Good Science
The metals in minerals are extracted using chemical processes,then physically refined.The type of chemical extraction process depends on how reactive the metal is.Metals with an intermediate reactivity,such as iron and zinc,exist as compounds which can be reduced by redox (displacement) reactions to yield pure metals.Iron Minerals Education CoalitionIron is the third most common element making up the Earth.Iron is one of the three naturally magnetic elements; the others are cobalt and nickel.Iron is the most magnetic of the three.The principle ores of iron are hematite (70% iron) and magnetite (72% iron).Taconite is a low grade iron ore,containing up to 30% magnetite and hematite.

## Iron processing
Iron processing Iron processing Ores: Iron ores occur in igneous,metamorphic (transformed),or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments.Most are sedimentary,but many have been changed by weathering,and so their precise origin is difficult to determine.The most widely distributed iron bearing minerals are oxides,and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3),which is.Mineral ExtractionA disadvantage to this method is that it can leave a large amount of mineral in place.Longwall mining allows for increased mineral extraction to occur,since it shears entire blocks of mineral onto a conveyor belt through the use of self advancing,hydraulic roof supports or shields.

## Extraction of Metals
Extraction of metals.The process of extracting metal ores buried deep underground is called Mining.The metal ores are found in the earth’s crust in varying abundance.The extraction of metals from ores is what allows us to use the minerals in the ground! The ores are very different from the finished metals that we see in buildings and bridges.IRON AND STEEL4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This page looks at the use of the Blast Furnace in the extraction of iron from iron ore,and the conversion of the raw iron from the furnace into various kinds of steel.The common ores of iron are both iron oxides,and these can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke.
