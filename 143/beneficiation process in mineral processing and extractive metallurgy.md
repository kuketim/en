## Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy
The first objective of Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy is to remove the Mineral as soon as freed and as coarse as possible” is the first rule in treating complex ores.Ores containing two or three metals have been satisfactorily treated for a number of years.Today,however,ores containing as high as four,five and even six and seven minerals are being efficiently concentrated.Process Of Coal BeneficiationBeneficiation Wikipedia.2019 10 06 In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy,beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals,which results in a higher grade product (concentrate) and a waste stream.
