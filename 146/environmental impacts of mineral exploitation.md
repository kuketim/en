## Assessment of environmental effects for mineral.
environmental impacts and mitigating measures that can be employed to minimise such effects.1.2 Relevant Legislation Sections 54,59,60 and 61 of the Crown Minerals Act (1991) cover the issue of right of access.The Act requires that both a permit and an access arrangement are needed before any prospecting,exploration orExploitation of natural resourcesThe exploitation of natural resources is the use of natural resources for economic growth,sometimes with a negative connotation of accompanying environmental degradation.It started to emerge on an industrial scale in the 19th century as the extraction and processing of raw materials (such as in mining,steam power,and machinery) developed much further than it had in preindustrial areas.

## Environmental impact of mining
Environmental impacts of mining can occur at local,regional,and global scales through direct and indirect mining practices.Impacts can result in erosion,sinkholes,loss of biodiversity,or the contamination of soil,groundwater,and surface water by the chemicals emitted from mining processes.These processes also have an impact on the atmosphere from the emissions of carbon which have.Mineral Exploitation by Adam Stroud on PreziOn average,borax is going to range anywhere from $3 to as much as $20.Depending on why you are using the borax,the costs can be different.Each use will require different amounts,therefore affecting the overall price.By Chloe and Adam Mineral exploitation has led to
