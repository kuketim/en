## Milling cutter
End mills (middle row in image) are those tools that have cutting teeth at one end,as well as on the sides.The words end mill are generally used to refer to flat bottomed cutters,but also include rounded cutters (referred to as ball nosed) and radiused cutters (referred to as bull nose,or torus).).Solid carbide end millsSimultaneously,it offers through HAIMER quality the best price performance ratio possible.HAIMER MILL solid carbide end mills can be used in almost all materials and are primarily suitable for roughing and finishing operations.A huge variety of chamfering end mills completes the HAIMER MILL line portfolio.
