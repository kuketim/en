## Types of Endless Splices for Conveyor Belts
For example: The linear bond of an 80 mm long finger by 20 mm wide is stronger than a 50 mm long finger by 20 mm wide.With a single ply belt,the user increases the linear bond through longer and or narrower fingers.If the conveyor belt has multiple plies,then the user will typically consider a Finger Over Finger splice.
