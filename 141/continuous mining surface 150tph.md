outside the mining area for placement and storage.In the Midwest,where the surface topography and coal seams are generally flat,it is common to employ area strip mining in which the fragmented overburden is placed directly by large draglines in the space created where coal has been mined ().In some situations in the eastern United States,a coal seam occurring near the top of mountains isStudy on new pattern of semi continuous mining system …Aiming at the problems that the stackers used in hillside dumps are inefficient because of the frequent system shifting,we propose a new semi continuous mining system that replaces the traditional belt conveyor stacker compounding by belt conveyor transfer.
