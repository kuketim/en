## Why Is Wind Energy Important? Reference.com
Why is wind energy important Wind energy is important because it holds immense potential in supplying electricity across the world.Unlike other sources of electricity that require fuel in processing plants,wind energy generates electricity through wind,which is free.Why Is Wind Energy Important? Reference.comWind energy doesn't cause acid rain or contribute to global climate change.Most other sources of power,including natural gas and coal,produce greenhouse gases,whereas wind energy produces none.Wind energy has a minimal impact on crop production and livestock grazing a

## How Does a Coal Power Plant Work?
Thermal based power plants can produce electricity from coal or other fuel sources.The coal fired process requires three different steps to turn energy released from burning coal to generating electricity for consumption.Coal fired power plants,while producing power,require a lot of water anWind power in DenmarkHistory.Danish inventor Poul la Cour experimented,taught and constructed wind power subjects around the year 1900.As concerns over global warming grew in the 1980s,Denmark found itself with relatively high carbon dioxide emissions per capita,primarily due to the coal fired electrical power plants that had become the norm after the 1973 and 1979 energy crises.

&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;WASHINGTON The Energy Department released a new report today highlighting strong growth in the U.S.wind energy market in 2011,increasing the U.S.share of clean energy and supporting tens of thousands of jobs,and underscoring the importance of continued policy support and clean energy tax credits to ensure that the manufacturing and jobs associated with this booming global industry.How much coal goes into a wind turbine? Debunk House&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;How much coal goes into a wind turbine?.Your end result was that it would take 10 months for a windmill to generate the same energy required to create it.Correct me if I am wrong but I‚Äôm pretty sure that these things last decades so after that first year its running in the green while your coal is long gone.Not only coal to build.
