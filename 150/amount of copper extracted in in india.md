Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.Zinc Production in Ancient India&quot;Zinc Production in Ancient India&quot; by J.S.Kharakwal,PhD 1.Introduction The metal using cultures appeared in the Indian sub continent around 6th millennium BCE.Subsequently,copper metallurgy is well attested to at various sites by the 4th millennium.

## How long will copper last?
How long will copper last? It is not possible to give an exact answer to this question for the following reasons: known deposits are being worked and new methods of copper extraction are being developed e.g.using bacteria to 'eat' the copper out of low grade oreMetals Found in Household E Waste Capital Scrap MetalPlaces like North America,India,and Europe invest a lot in the recycling of electronic waste.While harvesting gold is often the primary objective,the amount of copper and lead accumulated from e waste also adds up,and can be very lucrative too.
