## Improving Energy Efficiency in Barrick Grinding Circuits
Barrick Gold Corporation (Barrick) has undertaken innovative methods of evaluating and improving the performance of grinding mills in several of its operations around the world.The results have been positive with some of the mines showing more than 20% net energy.An Integrated Optimisation Study of the Barrick Osborne. MetsoSimulation to assess different strategies for improving flota tion circuit performance.• Simulation to assess the impact of changes in the crushing and grinding circuits on flotation performance.This was ultimately used to express the overall circuit efficiency in terms of kilowatts of electrical energy consumed per dollar of.
