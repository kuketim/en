## Ore
2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals,typically metals,that can be mined,treated and sold at a profit.Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined,often via smelting,to extract the valuable metals or minerals.The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.Use ore sorting equipment to concentrate ores and …4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;By using ore sorting equipment,ore concentrates can be created at very low cost in small or remote mining installations.The entire processing line can be planned in semi mobile form and consists only of crushers,screens,belts and sorting machines.This allows immense cost savings for transport,since the waste rock is disposed of on site.
