## Four Principles of Mill and Ball Ratio News Forging.
The Collocation between steel ball and ball mill exist certain principles.So,what are these principles?1,According to the power of the main motor of ball mill ball allowed determining the amount.Fill space load rate is in commonly 25% 35%,ball load rate is low and the power consumption is also reduced,but the productivity is low.TECHNICAL NOTES 8 GRINDING R.P.Kingthe mill is used primarily to lift the load (medium and charge).Additional power is required to keep the mill rotating.8.1.3 Power drawn by ball,semi autogenous and autogenous mills A simplified picture of the mill load is shown in Figure 8.3 Ad this can be used to establish the essential features of a model for mill …

## Planetary Ball Mill PM 100
Planetary Ball Mills are used wherever the highest degree of fineness is required.In addition to well proven mixing and size reduction processes,these mills also meet all technical requirements for colloidal grinding and provide the energy input necessary for mechanical alloying.The extremely high centrifugal forces of a planetary ball mill result in very high pulverization energy and.Calculate Ball Mill Grinding CapacityThe sizing of ball mills and ball milling circuits from laboratory grinding tests is largely a question of applying empirical equations or factors based on accumulated experience.Different manufacturers use different methods,and it is difficult to check the validity of the sizing estimates when estimates from different sources are widely divergent.

## List of types of mill
Ball mill,a mill using balls to crush the material Bead mill a type of Mill (grinding) Burr mill or burr grinder,a mill using burrs to crush the material,usually manufactured for a single purpose such as coffee beans,dried peppercorns,Ball Mills vs Rod MillsThus,quantitatively,less material can progress through the voids in the rod mill grinding media than in the ball mill,and the path of the material is more confined.This grinding action restricts the volume of feed which passes through the mill,without causing an overload condition.

## Rod mills,how they function
Rod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition,and broken and worn rods must be removed.
