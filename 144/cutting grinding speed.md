## GRINDING FEEDS AND SPEEDS
11&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The wheel speed,in terms of peripheral speed,is commonly in the range of 5,500 to 6,500 fpm (about 30 to 35 m sec).High speed grinding,operating at about twice that speed,is used on specially built surface grinding machines only,which are designed generally for abrasive machining and require appropriately manufactured grinding wheels.Cutting &amp; Grinding Welcome To Al TaherChemicalsCutting,grinding and finishing applications is a balance of numerous factors like choosing the right product and methods.There are various ways and means to select such right choices that help us in looking beyond the specific application and considering a bigger picture.

## Grinding (abrasive cutting)
Grinding is a subset of cutting,as grinding is a true metal cutting process.Each grain of abrasive functions as a microscopic single point cutting edge (although of high negative rake angle ),and shears a tiny chip that is analogous to what would conventionally be called a &quot;cut&quot; chip (turning,milling,drilling,tapping,etc.) [ citation needed ].Cutting speed — Klingspor Abrasive TechnologyThe cutting speed is the speed at which a tool blade is guided through the material to be processed along the cut it is performing.It is usually given in metres per minute (m min).Exceptions to this rule are grinding processes as well as some wood working.
