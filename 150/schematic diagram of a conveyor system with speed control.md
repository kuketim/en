10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In the design procedure of the elevator control circuit,the controller Datapath approach was used.In this approach,all the functional and memory are concentrated in the.the elevator control system sends a signal to the valve.The valve is operated.speeds up,so does the governor,therefore controlling the speed of the elevator car.MODULAR &amp; PORTABLE CONVEYOR BELT.SPEED …MODULAR &amp; PORTABLE CONVEYOR BELT.SPEED CONTROL BY ARDUINO: MODULAR PORTABLE CONVEYOR BELTThe idea of this project is to build a miniature replica of an industrial process,in this particular case a conveyor belt,to be used in educational environments for industrial automation training using PLC,Arduino.
