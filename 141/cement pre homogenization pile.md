## DESIGN OF PRESTRESSED CONCRETE PILE FOUNDATIONS
In order to select the proper size pre stressed concrete pile to use in the foundation,it is necessary to determine estimated pile lengths and maximum pile loads that can be developed by the soil In many instances,the maximum pile load is limited by the soil conditions rather than the structural pile capacity For example,a dense sand layer.TECHNICAL DETAILS AND SAMPLE CALCULATIONSPrestressed Piling Prestressed concrete piling are vital elements in the foundations of buildings,bridges and marine structures throughout the world They vary in size from 10 in (254 mm) square piles used in building foundations to the 66 in (1676 mm) diameter cylinder piles,

## PRESTRESSED CONCRETE PILES Semantic Scholar
Prestressed concrete piles have been constructed in the form of cy lindrical piles up to 4 m (131 ft) in diameter,as used on the Ooster schelde Bridge in the Netherlands,and up to 70 m (230 ft) long,as em ployed in off shore platforms in the Gulf of Maracaibo,Venezuela Pre stressed piles have been driven in increments,spliced together.What is Pile Foundation? Types of Pile Foundation Civil,Pre cast Concrete Pile The precast concrete pile is cast in pile bed in the horizontal form if they are rectangular in shape Usually,circular piles are cast in vertical forms Precast piles are usually reinforced with steel to prevent breakage during its mobilization from casting bed to the location of the foundation
