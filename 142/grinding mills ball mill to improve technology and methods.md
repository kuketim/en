## 5 Ways To Improve Grinding Efficiency Of Ball Mills News.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;According to Bond (1954),the grinding efficiency of a mill depends on the ball mill diameter,size of the media and mill speed.Ball mills with different length to diameter ratios for a particular power rating will produce different material retention times.TECHNICAL NOTES 8 GRINDING RP King Mineral Technologies.8.1.1 Grinding action.Industrial grinding machines used in the mineral processing industries are mostly of the tumbling mill type.These mills exist in a variety of types rod,ball,pebble autogenous and semi autogenous.The grinding action is induced by relative motion between the particles of media the rods,balls or&nbsp;.
