Powerful impact ball milling results in a perfect grinding efficiency.The Autofill system avoids direct contact with LN2 and makes cryogenic grinding very safe.Its versatility (cryogenic,wet and dry grinding at room temperature) makes the CryoMill the ideal grinder for quantities up to 20 ml.Size reductionFor ball milling,there is an optimum speed where the centrifugal force at the top of the mill is just balanced by the force of gravity.This caused the balls to be lifted to the maximum height before they fall onto the balls below,thus imparting the most kinetic energy.In practice,the ball mill is run at just below this speed (70 80%).
