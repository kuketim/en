## Tantalum
Tantalum is a chemical element with the symbol Ta and atomic number 73.Previously known as tantalium,it is named after Tantalus,a villain from Greek mythology.[5] Tantalum is a rare,hard,blue gray,lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosion resistant.It is part of the refractory metals group,which are widely used as minor.TICProduction of raw materials Extraction or production of tantalum raw materials of all kinds is widespread,whether by primary industrial mining,artisanal mining,as a secondary mineral or as a by product.Brazil is currently the major producer.Significant quantities.
