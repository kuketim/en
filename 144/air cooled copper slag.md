## Copper Slag: 7 Mohs Hardness
Copper slag is a byproduct obtained during smelting and refining of copper ore rich in sulphides and oxides of iron and copper,in the course of removing iron as iron silicate.During the smelting process at 1250&#176;C,copper liquid settles down due to higher density while copper slag remain on the surface in the segregated state.Sandbed Cooling Of Copper SlagSandbed Cooling Of Copper Slag compinnova.eu.The effect of primary copper slag cooling rate on the,Technological procedure of slow cooling slag from primary copper production is applied in the purpose of copper recovery in the level of 985% to blister This technological procedure is divided into two phases,first slow cooling of slag on the air for 24 hours,and then accelerated cooling.
