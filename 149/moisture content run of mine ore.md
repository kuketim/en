The polyhalite ore will undergo a simple process of crushing,grinding,granulation,screening and drying to produce the finished POLY4 (Sirius Minerals’ trademarked polyhalite product) granular product. Crushing: Run of mine ore is nominally crushed to below 50mm. Grinding: Crushed ore ground to …Dry Processing4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Then,material must be exposed to moisture reduction processes in order to be stacked and transported to the clients.This processing route is used for the ore that has low iron content.During the dry treatment,no water is added and,after crushing and screening,the ore is ready for the market.
