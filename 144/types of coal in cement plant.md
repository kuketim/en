## Bituminous Coal Characteristics and Applications
Oct 21,2019&#0183;&#32;Bituminous coal is so called because it contains a tar like substance called bitumen There are two types of bituminous coal: thermal and metallurgical Types of Bituminous Coal Thermal Coal: sometimes called steaming coal,is used to power plants that produce steam for electricity and industrial us Trains that run on steam sometimes are.Management of Environmental Quality: An International,cement plants which corresponds to 385 per cent of all industrial emissions in Europe or 32 per cent of the total European CO 2 emissions In a modern cement plant,60 per cent of the CO 2 emitted by a cement plant results from the calcinations of limestone,30 per cent from combustion of fuels in the kiln and 10 per cent from other

## Coal Analysis and Production Information Thermo Fisher …
Coal is a fossil fuel consisting mainly of carbonized,decayed,pre historic plant matter.It is a common energy source in the steel industry to extract iron from iron ore,and in the cement production process.The four main types of coal are lignite,sub bituminous.Coal in the cement industryCoal fineness has a direct relationship with its reactivity.Hence in the cement plant a special significance has been given to the milling behavior of coal.
