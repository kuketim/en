## Manganese: No Longer Just an Input on Steel
Industrial and Metallurgical Steel produced from iron contains a high amount of oxygen and some sulphur.Manganese plays a key role because of its ability to combine with sulphur,and its powerful deoxidation capacity.Without manganese,steel would have a low melting point.Around 30% of the manganese used today is for this purpose.Manganese: applications and uses MetalpediaManganese sulphate is widely used as an end product in fertilizers and animal feed,and as an intermediate product in the chemical industry.An organic manganese compound called MMT (methylcyclo pentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl) has been used as an octane booster or anti knock agent in unleaded gasoline.

## manganese Uses,Facts,&amp; Compounds Britannica
Most of the manganese produced is used in the form of ferromanganese and silicomanganese alloys for iron and steel manufacture.Manganese ores containing iron oxides are first reduced in blast furnaces or electric furnaces with carbon to yield ferromanganese,which in turn is used in steelmaking.Adding manganese,which has a greater affinity for sulfur than does iron,converts the low melting.Production and Supply Cobalt InstituteCobalt is widely scattered in the earth’s crust and is found in a variety of different ores in several countries.Cobalt is only extracted alone from the Moroccan and some Canadian arsenide ores.It is normally associated as a by product of copper or nickel mining operations.Around 55% of the world cobalt production comes from nickel ores.
