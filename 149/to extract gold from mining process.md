## Extracting Gold HowStuffWorks
Removing the gold bearing rock from the ground is just the first step.To isolate pure gold,mining companies use a complex extraction process.The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces.At a mill,large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel.Gold extraction process Kivu Mineral Mining CompanyThe mineralized rock at Kivu Mineral Mining would require multiple steps in processing to extract the gold.Mineralized rock is first crushed,then ground in large mills to create a fine,silt like powder.The gold bearing minerals are then separated from other materials using a process called “flotation.”
