## Where to Find Silver,Lead,Zinc Deposits Canada
Examples of the British Columbia and Yukon lead zinc ore deposits,all of the kind near igneous intrusions are described earlier.The high temperature minerals,garnet,epidote,pyroxene,biotite,and pyrrhotite,are found in some but not all of these deposits,and the silver and gold values are sometimes great enough to put the ore in the precious metals class.Copper,Lead and Zinc Smelting and Refining2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The major hazards are exposure to ore dusts during ore processing and smelting,metal fumes (including zinc and lead) during refining and roasting,sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide during most smelting operations,noise from crushing and grinding operations and from furnaces,heat stress from the furnaces and sulphuric acid and electrical.

Zinc ore occurs in two types of deposit: as primary zinc ore in thin veins known as rakes,or a secondary deposit formed by weathering of the primary mineral veins.Zinc ore is most commonly found as zinc carbonate (ZnCO 3),known as calamine or smithsonite.It generally occurs as rounded,crystalline crusts or granular,honeycombed masses that.MINERAL COMMODITIES OF NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR ZINC AND LEADzinc deposit.This came into pro duction in 1975 and closed in 1990,again following depletion of the ore reserves.Although there is currently no production of zinc or lead in the Province,there remains considerable potential for future discoveries.

Zinc is characterised as a bluish white,lustrous,diamagnetic metal,hard and brittle at most temperatures.Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust and is usually found in association with other base metals such as copper and lead in ores.Zinc prefers to bond with sulphides because of its low affinity (liking) for oxides.SEDEX: The Biggest Lead and Zinc Deposits in the …Discovered over 100 years ago,the Sullivan deposit was the largest SEDEX deposit in Canada,producing 116 million tonnes of zinc (5.8 % Zn) and lead (6.7 % Pb).The mine is no longer producing but Santa Fe Metals and Eagle Plains Resources are pursuing SEDEX prospects in the area.

28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Lead zinc (Pb Zn) deposits are typically classified by their ore formation processes and geological settings.Such deposits can be formed by the discharge of deep sedimentary brine onto the sea floor (sedimentary exhalative; SEDEX) or by replacement of limestone (Mississippi Valley type; MVT) 1,2,whereas some are associated with submarine volcanoes (volcanogenic massive sulfide; VMS) or …SEDEX: The Biggest Lead and Zinc Deposits in the World …Discovered over 100 years ago,the Sullivan deposit was the largest SEDEX deposit in Canada,producing 116 million tonnes of zinc (5.8 % Zn) and lead (6.7 % Pb).The mine is no longer producing but Santa Fe Metals and Eagle Plains Resources are pursuing SEDEX prospects in the area.

## Sediment Hosted Stratiform Deposits of Copper,Lead,…
Sediment hosted stratiform deposits of copper,lead,and zinc are distinguished from volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits by a lack of associated volcanism.They are distinguished from Mississippi Valley type deposits by an early timing of mineralization relative to deposition of host sediments,by greater conformity with their hosts,and by higher iron sulfide and silver contents.
