## The Economics of Coal
While global demand for thermal coal is strong,coal destined for steel production is the most profitable for producers.Last year,met coal made up 53% of total coal exports and this share is likely to move higher over the next few years.Energy in a Ton of CoalOn average,a ton of coal produces 21 to 22 gigajoules of energy.The amount of energy produced by a ton of coal is largely dependent upon the type of coal being burned.There are four major categories of coal,each differing in composition and age.Lignite,also known as brown coal,is …

## Coal imports and exports
The United States is a net exporter of coal,meaning that it exports more coal to other countries than it imports from other countries.In 2012,U.S.coal exports reached a record high of 126 MMst,equal to 12% of U.S.coal production in 2012.U.S.coal exports declined each year from 2012 through 2016 and then increased in 20.FEATURE: Sustainability may have large role in steel.Many sustainability related projects in metals and mining may be pushed harder if there are less growth projects due to market uncertainty from COVID,said BMO Capital Markets head of commodities research Colin Hamilton.The process of reducing iron with coal remains the largest source of CO2 emissions for the steel industry.

## Use of coal
Many industries use coal and coal byproducts.The concrete and paper industries burn large amounts of coal to produce heat.The steel industry uses coal indirectly to make steel.Coal coke is made by baking coal in furnaces.The steel industry uses coal coke to smelt iron ore into iron to make steel.RAW MATERIALS worldsteelThe most efficient steel companies have reduced their energy consumption per tonne of steel by around 60% since 1960.Today,it is estimated that the global steel industry used about 2 billion tonnes of iron ore,1 billion tonnes of metallurgical coal and 575 million tonnes of recycled steel to produce about 1.7 billion tonnes of crude steel.
