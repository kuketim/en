Each mill system consists of a separate exhauster,control damper,cold and hot temper ing air dampers,gravimetric coal feeder,Combustion Engineering No.RPS703 mill,riffle dis tributors,and DB Riley SLS 140 internal dynamic classifier.(See Figures 1 andDSS055: Coal Mill Safety In Cement Production Industries.Power generation typically involves direct firing systems.There is an air swept mill with direct pneumatic conveying through to the burners.The risk of explosions is more or less reduced to an explosion inside the mill,which therefore needs to be explosion,pressure,and shock resistant.NFPA requires coal mills to be good for 50 PSI.
