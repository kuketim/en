## Why We Test Concrete Compressive Strength after 28 …
Why do we test concrete compressive strength after 28 days? Concrete gains strength with time after casting.It takes much time for concrete to gain 100% strength and the time for same is still unknown.The rate of gain of concrete compressive strength in higherMix Design For M35 Grade Of ConcreteThe mix design for M35 Grade Of Concrete for pile foundations provided here is for reference purpose only.Actual site conditions vary and thus this should be adjusted as per the location and other factors.Grade of Concrete : M35 Characteristic Strength (Fck) : 35

## Concrete
Concrete is strong in compression,as the aggregate efficiently carries the compression load.However,it is weak in tension as the cement holding the aggregate in place can crack,allowing the structure to fail.Reinforced concrete adds either steel reinforcing bars,steel fibers,aramid fibers,carbon fibers,glass fibers,or plastic fibers to carry tensile loads.What is meant by “Characteristic strength” (fck) of …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;From the graph we can clearly say that 30 MPa is the characteristic strength of the given concrete mix.The value of fck is lower than fcm (40 MPa mean strength) by 1.64σ,where σ is the standard deviation of the normal distribution.So we can say the given
