## Why is the extraction of copper from pyrites.
The Gibbs free energy of formation (Δ f G) of Cu 2 S is less than that of H 2 S and CS 2.Therefore,H 2 and C cannot reduce Cu 2 S to Cu.On the other hand,the Gibbs free energy of formation of Cu 2 O is greater than that of CO.Hence,C can reduce Cu 2 O to Cu.C (s) +Cu 2 O (s) → 2Cu (s) + CO (g).Hence,the extraction of copper from its pyrite ore is difficult than from its oxide ore.The 10 Biggest Copper Stocks The Motley FoolWhile BHP is a top copper producer,its biggest moneymaker is iron ore.In 2018,that metal contributed 39% of the group's underlying EBITDA,followed by copper at 28%,coal at 19%,and oil and.

## Copper Mining and Production Processes Explained
Copper ores An ore is a rock containing enough valuable mineral to make it worth extracting.In the case of copper,it is worth extracting when there is about 2 kg of copper per 1,000 kg of ore (0.2%).Copper minerals are found in over one hundred varieties,although.ore National Geographic SocietyOre is a deposit in Earth’s crust of one or more valuable minerals.The most valuable ore deposits contain metals crucial to industry and trade,like copper,gold,and iron.Copper ore is mined for a variety of industrial uses.Copper,an excellent conductor of electricity,is used as electrical wire.Copper is also used in construction.

1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The barren rock,or gangue has to be separated from the sulfide minerals in order to smelt the metallic copper from the ore.By far the greatest proportion of copper is extracted from the sulfides of copper,iron and sometimes other metals.Such ores originate from sulfur bearing volcanic magmas,which have separated into metal sulfides and siliceous melts.Re Os Dating for Molybdenite from Qulong Porphyry Copper.Qulong deposit located in Gangdese granitoid batholite in the eastern Gangdese metallogenic belt is one of typical porphyry type copper deposits.High precise dating of Re Os for molybdenite determined the mineralization age of Qulong copper deposit.The Re Os.

## Copper production &amp; environmental impact
• Copper tools started to emerge as early as 3500 BC in Israel.Its property of alloying with other metals (particularly tin) was discovered about 500 years later and heralded the Bronze Age,which started in southern Europe between 30 BC.
