## Factors Affecting Ball Mill Grinding Efficiency
The following are factors that have been investigated and applied in conventional ball milling in order to maximize grinding efficiency: a) Mill Geometry and Speed Bond (1954) observed grinding efficiency to be a function of ball mill diameter,and established empirical relationships for recommended media size and mill speed that take this factor into account.How to Measure Grinding EfficiencyThe first two Grinding Efficiency Measurement examples are given to show how to calculate Wio and Wioc for single stage ball mills.Figure 1.The first example is a comparison of two parallel mills from a daily operating report.Mill size 5.03m x 6.1m (16.5′ x 20′ with a ID of 16′).This example shows that Mill 2 is slightly more efficient th
