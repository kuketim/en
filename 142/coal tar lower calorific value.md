## Lower and Higher Heating Values of Fuels Hydrogen Tools
Lower and Higher Heating Values of Fuels,The lower heating value (also known as net calorific value) of a fuel is defined as the amount of heat released by combusting a specified quantity (initially at 25&#176;C) and returning the temperature of the combustion products to 150&#176;C,which assumes the latent heat of vaporization of water in the.Calorific value « Firewood in theory and practiceCalorific value of selected fuels The calorific value of wood on the background of other wood fuels,presents quite interesting,wood is not much weaker fuel than coal Of course,no longer and in any way it can compete with coal,which has the calorific value half as higher

## Fuels: Definition,Types,Requirements and Calorific Value …
Net or Lower Calorific Value : When the heat absorbed by the products of combustion is not recovered,and the steam formed during combustion is not condensed,then the amount of heat obtained per kg of the fuel is known as net calorific value.It is briefly L.CHeat of combustion WikipediaThe quantity known as lower heating value (LHV) (net calorific value (NCV) or lower calorific value (LCV)) is determined by subtracting the heat of vaporization of the water from the higher heating value This treats any H 2 O formed as a vapor The energy required to vaporize the water therefore is not released as heat
