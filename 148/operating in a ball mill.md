Optimization of mill performance by using online ball and pulp measurements In the platinum industry,by increasing the solid content in the slurry,the product becomes finer.At a higher percentage solid than 73 to 74%,the product becomes coarser again.At thisBall MillBall mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore.The balls are initially 5 10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds.The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol. % ore and 25% steel.The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle size measurement device and size control cyclones.

## Optimization of mill performance by using
Usually,plant operators use mill power readings as an indicator of ball filling degree and,often,try to keep it at the maximum level.It is well known that the mill absorbed power depends on operating parameters other than ball level,such as pulp density and liner configuration.Figure 2 shows that there is no linear relation betweenOperating Ball Mill PlantsBall mill operating systems granite crushing plant jaw ball mill operating systems shfwh autogenous mills semiautogenous mills and ball ball mill for grinding limestone for a flue gas desulphurisation system in a korean power station reagent.
