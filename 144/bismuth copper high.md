## How to Grow Bismuth Crystals
Bismuth has a low melting point (271&#176;C or 520&#176;F),so it is easy to melt over high cooking heating.You are going to grow the crystals by melting the bismuth in a metal &quot;dish&quot; (which will have a higher melting point than the bismuth),separate the pure bismuth from its impurities,allow the bismuth to crystallize,and pour away the remaining liquid bismuth from the crystals before it freezes.Silver Bismuth Alloy AMERICAN ELEMENTSBismuth has a high electrical resistance,and has the highest Hall Effect of any metal (i.e.greatest increase in electrical resistance when placed in a magnetic field).Bismuth is found in bismuthinite and bismite It is also produced as a byproduct of lead,copper,

## How to Remove Arsenic,Antimony &amp; Bismuth from Copper
The products,refined copper and refinery slag,together contain quantities of arsenic,antimony and bismuth equal to those present in the blister copper subjected to the operation.In the tables on p.663 the products of refining are calculated from the working results on 100 tons of blister copper.Segregation of bismuth to triple junctions in copper — …Bismuth segregation in copper has been studied using energy dispersive X ray spectrometry (EDX) in a JEOL 2010F transmission electron microscope.In addition to the expected solute enrichment at grain boundaries,we have observed extremely high concentrations of bismuth at certain triple junctions,with significantly greater enrichment factors than in the adjacent grain boundaries.

## Copper bismuth alloys
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Bismuth,which is adjacent to lead in the Periodic Table,is non toxic.It is virtually insoluble in the solid state and precipitates as pure globules during freezing in a copper base alloy.When alloyed with copper,bismuth produces a course grain size that promotesRecovery of bismuth and arsenic from copper smelter flue …Leaching of the copper smelter flue dusts after copper and zinc extraction Leaching the dusts was carried out at 60 &#176;C for 2 h and at a stirring speed of 700 rpm,a liquid solid ratio of 2.Preliminary experiments showed that at these conditions,the leaching efficiencies of bismuth and arsenic could reach up to about 90%.
