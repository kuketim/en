## SART Mining SGS
We provide flowsheet development,testing,pilot plant development and ongoing support at full sized operations using SART and other cyanide recovery processes.Contact us early in your proposal and planning stage to see if SART can improve the bottom line,ensure regulatory compliance in your gold recovery operation and improve your environmental footprint.Gold Extraction &amp; Recovery ProcessesThere are many arrangements and combinations using flotation in conjunction with treatment of gold ores.The two gold process flowsheets shown,with some variations,are probably the most commonly used.In Gold Flowsheet No.1 the ore is ground in water to such a size as to free the minerals sufficiently to produce a tailing by flotation low enough in value that it may be discarded.
