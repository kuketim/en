## Smelting of Lead Ores using High Lime Slags
The preliminary removal of the zinc from a lead zinc ore permits of an improvement in lead metallurgy This subject has been quite fully covered in a previous paper by me and in articles by F L Wilson and others The methods of sampling ores today are practically the same as,Zinc processing BritannicaZinc processing,the extraction of zinc from its ores and the preparation of zinc metal or chemical compounds for use in various products Zinc (Zn) is a metallic element of hexagonal close packed (hcp) crystal structure and a density of 713 grams per cubic centimetre

## Zinc Essential Chemical Industry
Zinc Zinc is often found in nature together with lead in sulfide or The metals are separated during refining As zinc is resistant to corrosion and easy to apply,much of it is used to protect iron and steel based products Uses of zinc Zinc is used as coating to protect iron and steel from corroding in the atmosphere,water and soilZinc OreGold recovery from copper zinc ores is usually higher than that obtained from either a lead zinc or copper lead zinc ore.This is attributed to two main factors.When selecting a reagent scheme for treatment of copper zinc ores,there are more choices than for the other ore types,which can lead to the selection of a reagent scheme which is more favourable for gold flotation.
