## Autogenous and Semi Autogenous Mills
The designs of autogenous and semi autogenous (SAG) grindings mills are described followed by the description of their methods of operation in grinding circuits involving crushers and ball mills.Methods of estimating SAG mill volumes,mill charges,feed size and power consumptions and optimum speeds of rotation during operation are described.Difference Between Sag Mill vs Ball Mill&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;SAG mill make use of steel balls included with some large and hard rocks for grinding.These mills utilize the balls in making the large fragments of materials broken into pieces.The ball charge of a SAG mill is about 9% to 20%.This process takes place inside the large rotating drum of SAG mill which is filled with balls partially.

SAG is an acronym for semi autogenous grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter,poweredOptimization and Control of a Primary SAG Mill Using Real.Each Module at Waterval Concentrator (WvalC) employs a φ7.3 m x 8.2 m EGL SAG mills with 2 x 5200 kW motors in primary milling duty.Two silos containing Merensky and UG2 ore respectively feed the mill that operates at a fixed 75% of the critical speed.Th
