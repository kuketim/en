## SparkNotes: Aggregate Supply: Terms and Formulae
Aggregate supply = Y = Ynatural + a(P Pexpected) In this formula Y is output,Ynatural is the natural rate of output that exists when all productive factors are used at their normal rates,a is a constant greater than zero,P is the price level,and Pexpected is the expected price levelDeriving the short run aggregate supply curveThe short run supply curves hold true for price equal or greater than the average variable cost as previously thoroughly explained Now,if srasc shifts to the right and long run supply curve shifts to the right because natural level of output increases then,

Short run aggregate supply (SRAS) — During the short run,firms possess one fixed factor of production (usually capital),and some factor input prices are sticky The quantity of aggregate output supplied is highly sensitive to the price level,as seen in the flat region of the curve in the above diagramChapter 19 Output and In ﬂation in the Short Run,Figure 192: Aggregate supply in the short run (SRAS) and in the long run (LRAS) Allowing for Supply Shocks A change in the expected in ﬂation rate is not the only source of shifts in the short run aggregate supply curve To see this,we go back to equation (18) in Chapter 18 which showed that the natural rate of unemployment is given by u.

## Aggregate Supply Boundless Economics
Short run Aggregate Supply.In the short run,the aggregate supply is graphed as an upward sloping curve.The equation used to determine the short run aggregate supply is: Y = Y * + α(P P e).In the equation,Y is the production of the economy,Y* is the natural level of production of the economy,the coefficient α is always greater than 0,P is the price level,and P e is the expected price.Aggregate Supply in the Short RunLearn about aggregate supply in the short run (SRAS) and what that really means.Find out how the overall price of goods affects quantity supplied.
