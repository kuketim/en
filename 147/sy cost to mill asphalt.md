## Microsurfacing vs.Asphalt Mill &amp; Fill
Microsurfacing and Asphalt Mill &amp; Fill are pavement preservation techniques that are less expensive than repaving.Compare the differences between them.According to a recent eco efficiency analysis of asphalt pavement technology,it was found that microsurfacing is not only more economical but also causes less environmental impact than the traditional mill and fill strategy.Microsurfacing vs.Asphalt Mill &amp; FillThe resulting impact is that mill and fill requires 25 percent more work and cost despite the more frequent applications required for microsurfacing.In the end,the study proves microsurfacing is the more cost and eco efficient strategy for maintaining asphalt pavement surfaces.
