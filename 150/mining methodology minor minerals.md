## Surface mining
Surface mining,including strip mining,open pit mining and mountaintop removal mining,is a broad category of mining in which soil and rock overlying the mineral deposit (the overburden) are removed,in contrast to underground mining,in which the overlying rock is left in place,and the mineral is removed through shafts or tunnels.Surface.(8) Chapter 4CHAPTER 4 MINING RECEIPTS 4.1 Introduction Minerals are classified as Major minerals (iron ore,manganese,gold etc.) and Minor minerals (sand,granite,gravel,building stone etc).Mines are allotted sanctioned for excavation of minerals in the form of Mining.
