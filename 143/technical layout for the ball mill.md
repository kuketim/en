Ball Mill Layout.A Ball mill is a horizontal cylinder partly filled with steel balls (or occasionally other shapes) that rotates on its axis,imparting a tumbling and cascading action to the balls.Material fed through the mill is crushed by impact and ground by attrition between the balls.Ball MillsIn all ore dressing and milling Operations,including flotation,cyanidation,gravity concentration,and amalgamation,the Working Principle is to crush and grind,often with rob mill &amp; ball mills,the ore in order to liberate the minerals.In the chemical and process industries,grinding is an important step in preparing raw materials for subsequent treatment.
