## What is Longwall Mining? (with pictures)
 · Longwall mining is a highly productive underground coal mining technique.Longwall mining machines consist of multiple coal shearers mounted on a series of self advancing hydraulic ceiling supports.The entire process is mechanized.Longwall mining machines are about 800 feet (240 meters) in width and 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3 meters) tall.CDCIn coal mining,longwall mining is a preferred method to maximize production by extracting large blocks of coal that have been outlined with a set of development entries.In U.S.mines,longwall panels are typically 1,000 ft wide (with a continual trend toward even wider panels) and usually over 10,000 ft long.

## Longwall Mining Overview Introduction underground COAL
LONGWALL MINING Overview.In the method of secondary extraction known as longwall mining a relatively long mining face (typically in the range 100 to 300m but may be longer) is created by driving a roadway at right angles between two roadways that form the sides of the longwall block,with one rib of this new roadway forming the longwall face.3 Technologies in Exploration,Mining,and Processing.2 天前&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The life cycle of mining begins with exploration,continues through production,and ends with closure and postmining land use.New technologies can benefit the mining industry and consumers in all stages of this life cycle.This report does not include downstream processing,such as smelting of.
