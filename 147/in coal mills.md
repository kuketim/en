## Coal Fired Power Plant Case Study: Coal Crusher Gearbox.
The Problem Coal fired power plants typically operate several ball mills or coal pulverizing mills to crush the incoming coal to the optimum size for combustion.This means that each power generation unit has five or six mills.The gearboxes that run these coal mills are usually lubricated with high viscosity oil,such as ISO VG320 or ISO VG460.Long lasting coal mill for efficient grinding FLSmidthThe ATOX&#174; Coal Mill handles feed materials with less than one percent moisture and up to 25 percent moisture,where abrasiveness and stickiness is not an issue for grinding.Long lasting durability.The materials used to produce the ATOX&#174; Coal Mill’s segmented wear surfaces are durable and therefore,last longer.
