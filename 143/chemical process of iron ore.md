The direct production of steel from iron ore in the electric furnace has never passed beyond the laboratory stage.Just as pig iron can be produced from iron ore in the electric furnace,so can pig steel be produced by a close regulation of the carbon content of the charge.Iron Essential Chemical IndustryIron is produced by reduction of iron ore,which is often a mixture of oxides,using carbon,carbon monoxide,and hydrogen.While the blast furnace is the dominant reduction process other technologies are emerging which operate on a smaller scale.

The most primitive facility used to smelt iron is a bloomery.There,a blacksmith burns charcoal with iron ore and a good supply of oxygen (provided by a bellows or blower).Charcoal is essentially pure carbon.The carbon combines with oxygen to create carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (releasing lots of heat in the process).Carbon and carbonHow is Iron Refined from Ore? (with pictures)&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Although iron does not occur in its pure form in nature,some kinds of ore contain up to 70% iron atoms.Iron ore consists of oxygen and iron atoms bonded together into molecules.To create pure iron,one must deoxygenate the ore,leaving only iron atoms behind,which is the essence of the refining process.

## What is the chemical equation for making iron from its ore.
 · The conversion of the Iron ore to the metallic Iron is a chemical reduction,but depends upon the chemical nature of the ore being used,for example: 2 Fe2O3 + 3 C (as coke) > 4 Fe + 3 CO2 (g) This is actually a series of reactions that are temperature dependent.3 Fe2O3 + CO > CO2 + 2 Fe3O4 (Begins at 850° F) Fe3O4 + CO > CO2 + 3 FeO.Processes and Procedures in the Extraction of IronThe extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process.The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace.These materials are loaded into.

## Iron Ore: Sedimentary Rock Pictures,Definition & More
What is Iron Ore? Earth's most important iron ore deposits are found in sedimentary rocks.They formed from chemical reactions that combined iron and oxygen in marine and fresh waters.The two most important minerals in these deposits are iron oxides: hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4).These iron ores have been mined to produce.Iron Ore Processing for the Blast FurnaceIron Ore Processing for the Blast Furnace (Courtesy of the National Steel Pellet Company) The following describes operations at the National Steel Pellet Company,an iron ore mining and processing facility located on the Mesabi Iron Range of Minnesota.Creating steel from low grade iron ore requires a long process of mining,crushing,
