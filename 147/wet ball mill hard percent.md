## Ball Mill: Operating principles,components,Uses.
A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis.The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 50% of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.Hard Milling By The Numbers : Modern Machine Shop&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The problem with switching to a new and different method of machining is that your old and established expectations may not help you anymore.Many shops have implemented hard milling through high speed machining as a way to generate intricate die and mold forms on the machining center,with less need for EDM and hand finishing.
