## Mill Sites on the Eno River; A Geological Viewpoint &#171; Eno.
Downstream from West Point where the Eno flows in the sedimentary rocks of the Triassic Basin,the river meanders and occupies a much broader valley (Figure 4c).The river is not cutting down as much as it was in the Piedmont,and the sedimentary rocks over which it is flowing are soft and easily eroded.Environmental Setting of the Yellowstone River Basin,…Sedimentary rocks of the Cretaceous System extend over most of the plains and basins of the YRB,but are deeply buried at many locations.Where these rock units crop out,as they do in about 23 percent of the study unit,they usually are tilted and often

## Sedimentary processes,rocks and environments
SEDIMENTARY ROCKS: There are two groups of sedimentary rocks.One group is the clastic or detrital sedimentary rocks.These are rocks composed primarily of fragments (i.e.clasts,or detritus) of pre existing rocks.They are formed by the processes described above.A second group are the chemical and biochemical sedimentary rocks.Dissloved in.Sedimentary StructuresSedimentary Structures.STRATIFICATION refers to the way sediment layers are stacked over each other,and can occur on the scale of hundreds of meters,and down to submillimeter scale.It is a funda

## Concretion
A concretion is a hard,compact mass of matter formed by the precipitation of mineral cement within the spaces between particles,and is found in sedimentary rock or soil.[1] Concretions are often ovoid or spherical in shape,although irregular shapes also occur.The word 'concretion' is derived from the Latin con meaning 'together' and.Geology of MauritaniaThe geology of Mauritania is built on more than two billion year old Archean crystalline basement rock in the Reguibat Shield of the West African Craton,a section of ancient and stable continental crust.Mobile belts and the large Taoudeni Basin formed and filled with sediments in the connection with the Pan African orogeny mountain building event 600 million years ago and a subsequent orogeny.
