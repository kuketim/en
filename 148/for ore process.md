## Mines and environmental impact
Tailings.Tailings are a fine grained residue,mainly consisting of gangue minerals that remain after the separation of valuable minerals and metals from their ore in a processing facility.Tailings are deposited in the vicinity of the mine and are therefore pumped together with process water to large ponds,known as tailings&nbsp;.Introduction to Mineral Processing6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Introduction to Mineral Processing.In ore beneficiation,flotation is a process in which valuable minerals are separated from worthless material or other valuable minerals by inducing them to gather in and on the surface of a froth layer.Sulfide and non sulfide minerals as well as native metals are recovered by froth flotation.
