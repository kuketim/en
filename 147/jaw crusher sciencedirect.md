## Jaw Crusher Feeding
Jaw Crusher ScienceDirect.The ore is to be broken down in a jaw crusher to pass through a 11.5 cm screen.The undersize is scalped before feeding to the jaw crusher.Assuming the maximum feed rate is maintained at 30 t h and the shapes of feed and product are the same and the crusher set is 10 cm,estimate the size of jaw crusher required and.jaw crusher of1610Manganese Ferroalloys Technology ScienceDirect.Usually jaw and cone crushers in combination and roller crushers are used.The latter can be used for materials that already have the right size in one direction.Besides eliminating the secondary crusher,a notable feature of the roller crusher is that it generates fewer fines (Olsen et al.
