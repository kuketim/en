## Drilling fluid
In geotechnical engineering,drilling fluid,also called drilling mud,is used to aid the drilling of boreholes into the earth.Often used while drilling oil and natural gas wells and on exploration drilling rigs,drilling fluids are also used for much simpler boreholes,such as …11.THE TOTAL GAMMA RAY LOG 11.1 IntroductionTable 11.1 illustrates the effect of the interplay between the statistical fluctuations,the gamma count rate andT c for a single formation with a constant radioactivity.In this example we assume that the logging speed is 1 foot per second &#215; T c.If the time constant
