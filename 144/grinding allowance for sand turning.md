## GRINDING MACHINES
11&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;GRINDING MACHINES Grinding is the process of removing metal by the application of abrasives which are bonded to form a rotating wheel.When.Remove workpiece from grinding wheel before turning machine off.Use proper wheel guards on all grinding machines.On bench grinders,adjust tool rest 1 16 to 1 8 inch from the wheel.1.Machining Tolerances ChinaSavvyMachining Tolerances Also referred to as dimensional accuracy,machining tolerances is the amount of deviation in a specific dimension of a part caused by the manufacturing process.Assigned as boundaries for acceptable build,dimensional tolerances are assigned to parts,with acceptable degrees of variation set simply because no machines are.
