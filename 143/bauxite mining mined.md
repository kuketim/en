Bauxite is transported by any number of means including off and on road trucks,rail,conveyor systems,ships and even as piped slurries.Typical mining and transport equipment.The Haul trucks emptying run of mine (ROM) bauxite into crushers for the initial stages of comminution Crushed bauxite transport via a covered conveyorMining and Refining RehabilitationThe area of mined land rehabilitated every year globally is equivalent in size to the area newly mined.Bauxite mining operations aim to restore the pre mining environment and respective conditions; returning the original ecosystem as close as possible,in terms of structure,function and dynamics and creating a land use to benefit the local.

## Bauxite Mining and the Environment
The conservation of rain forests is a key concern often voiced with regard to bauxite mining.Only about 6 % of the world’s bauxite mining is today conducted in rain forest regions,affecting a total area of around 1.5 km 2 per year.The total area of the globe currently covered by rain forest is about 18 million km 2.The original flora and fauna of much of the land involved in bauxite.Bauxite mininig in Guinea PR Wirtgen4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Guinea: Bauxite mining with surface miners maximizes profitability West African Guinea is known for possessing the largest reserves of high quality bauxite in the world.This potential has prompted the country to continually expand its bauxite mining …

## Bauxite mining: Nyinahin elders demand agreement …
3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Research shows that bauxite mining at Nyinahin could last for over 150 to 300 years; and is estimated at $45 billion.This is significantly longer than at Atewa where,according to research,bauxite can only be mined for 30 years.BauxiteThe bauxite mines in the Darling Range have the world's lowest grade bauxite mined on a commercial scale (around 30% Al 2 O 3).Despite the low grade,the mines accounted for 23% of global alumina production as they also have low reactive silica,making the bauxite relatively easy to refine.

## Bauxite mining in the United States
Bauxite mining in the United States produced an estimated 128,000 metric tonnes of bauxite in 2013.Although the United States was an important source of bauxite in the early 20th century,it now supplies less than one percent of world bauxite production.Mining Ghana’s bauxite would bring.28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mining Ghana’s bauxite would bring in billions from China.But it could also taint the water for 5 million people.Forest wardens walk into the Atewa Forest Reserve in Ghana,where millions of.
