## How to Measure Grinding Efficiency
The first two Grinding Efficiency Measurement examples are given to show how to calculate Wio and Wioc for single stage ball mills.Figure 1.The first example is a comparison of two parallel mills from a daily operating report.Mill size 5.03m x 6.1m (16.5‚Ä≤ x 20‚Ä≤ with a ID of 16‚Ä≤).This example shows that Mill 2 is slightly more efficient than Mill 1 even though it has a higher ‚Ä¶Cement grinding Vertical roller mills versus ball millsgrinding of raw materials.The grinding efficiency of the vertical roller mill combined with an ability to dry,grind and classify within a single unit gives the vertical roller mill a decided advantage over a ball mill system.However,despite these benefits,applications of the vertical roller mill for cement grinding are less prevalent.
