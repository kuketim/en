## Leaching of Sphalerite with Hydrogen Peroxide and Nitric Acid
Examination of the effect of nitric acid concentrations on the leaching efficiency of sphalerite with hydrogen peroxide (5.20 mol L) was also carried out at nitric acid concentrations in the range of 1.0 11.4 mol L.Figure 3 shows that an increase in concentration ofneutralize nitric acid in Aqua Regia&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Hi,How can I neutralize nitric acid in Aqua Regia? I try with Urea on hot plate and I see stop fizzing my AR when I add an equal amount Urea with nitric acid.So,in this solution I have copper,silver and other metals because I try to refine gold directly from cell.
