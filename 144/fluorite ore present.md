## Flotation separation of fluorite from calcite using …
In this study,sulfonated lignite (SL) was studied as the depressant in the separation of fluorite and calcite with sodium oleate (NaOL) as the collector.The flotation recovery of fluorite and calcite with and without depressant SL was investigated by micro flotation test.CN101507948AThe invention discloses a collector for the floatation of fluorite at a low temperature.The collector comprises the following raw materials in weight portion: 35 to 45 portions of fatty alcohol polyethenoxy ether carboxylic acid sodium,40 to 50 portions of sodium cetanesulfonate,and 8 to 12 portions of fatty acid methyl ester sodium sulfonate.

## A New Classification Scheme of Fluorite Deposits
Fluorite deposits occur in a variety of geologic environments throughout the globe.It may occur as the main or only economically recoverable ore mineral in deposits or may present as the accessory gangue minerals with other ores.It is therefore necessary to understand various genetic types of the fluorite deposit.The present paper synthesises the information of some of the known fluorite.:About usAt present,our company is the biggest company in the fluorite Industry of China in terms of resources reserves,Mining and processing scales.We are receiving high reputation in this tirade for leading mining operation,management level,selecting technology and environmental governance,etc.
