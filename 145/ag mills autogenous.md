## Autogenous mill and semi autogenous mill
Autogenous (AG) and semi autogenous (SAG) mills have been used for over 20 years for the coarse grinding of diverse ores (including gold,copper and iron ores).They offer advantages with regard to capital costs and operating expense compared to the secondary and tertiary crushers used in conventional size reduction systems.Outotec Grinding technologiesAG and SAG mills Autogenous and semi autogenous mills are designed for grinding or primary crushed ore and are the most widely used in concentrators globally.Ball mills Ball mills are typically used for secondary and or tertiary grinding to prepare the material for downstream concentration processes.Rod mills Rod mills are mainly used for.
