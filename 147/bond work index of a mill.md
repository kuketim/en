The Bond Ball Mill Work Index is a measure of the resistance of the material to grinding in a ball mill.It can be used to determine the grinding power required for a given throughput of material under ball mill grinding conditions.It is a 'locked cycle' test conducted in closed circuit with a laboratory screen.Tubular Rod MillsData: Laboratory Standard Bond Test: Rod Mill: Grindability index at 10 mesh = 13.5 kWh t.Solution Step 1.From Equation (3.3),the work is given by W o r k = 10 W i 1 P 80 − 1 F 80 kWh t (A factor of 1.1 may be required if the work index is in kWh short ton) Substituting values W o r k = 10 &#215; 13.5 1 1000 − 1 16,000 = 3.20 kWh t.Step.
