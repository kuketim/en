## Jet milling from a particle perspective Research.
Jet milling is a well established technique for milling of pharmaceutically active compounds.Inherent to processing of active pharmaceutical ingredients concomitant subtle changes in the physical state may occur.In general the milling kinetics in a mill is described by the selection function,also often referred to as the rate of breakage.Transformations of crystalline sugars upon milling.In this paper we compare the solid state transformations upon room temperature milling of four sugars: lactose,trehalose,mannitol and sorbitol.The two disaccharides (lactose and trehalose) are found to undergo a direct transformation from crystal to glass while the two sugar al
