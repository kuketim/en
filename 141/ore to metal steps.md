## How Metals are Mined Cooperative Extension Service
Ore processing separating the valuable minerals (such as gold) from the rocks takes place in the mill facilities,usually as close as possible to the mining site to reduce hauling costs While there are many ways to process different kinds of ore,generally the mill starts by grinding ore into a powderHow is Iron Refined From the Ore? innovateusIron ores are mainly iron oxides and include magnetite,siderite,limonite and hematite The iron content of these ores ranges from 70% down to 20% or less coke is a substance made by heating coal,till it becomes pure carbon

## Commercial Lithium Production and the Mining of Lithium
For decades,commercial lithium production relied upon mineral ore sources such as spodumene,petalite,and lepidolite However,extracting lithium from such sources is significantly more costly than extracting the metal from lithium containing brin In fact,the cost of extracting lithium from.Iron Ore Smelting Process Brighthub EngineeringIron Ore Smelting Process Using Modern Blast Furnac,When the metal is molten,oxygen is injected into it,with the impurities being converted to oxides and forming a slag The oxygen also reacts with the carbon forming CO which is combusted adding heat to the process Oxygen injection also reduces the carbon,nitrogen and hydrogen.
