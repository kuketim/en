## Ball Mills
For many decades the two compartment ball mill in closed circuit with a high efficiency separator has been the mill of choice.In the last decade vertical mills have taken an increasing share of the cement milling market,not least because the specific power consumption of vertical mills is about 30% less than that of ball mills and for finely ground cement less still.Optimization of mill performance by using2015 4 16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;operating parameters other than ball level,such as pulp density and liner configuration.Figure 2 shows that there is no linear relation between mill absorbed power and ball filling degree.As indicated on the graph,a small variation in power could be ‚Ä¶
