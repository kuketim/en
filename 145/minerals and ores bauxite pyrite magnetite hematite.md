## Set of 20 Metallic Ores Collection of Metallic Ores.
An ore is a type of rock that contains minerals with important elements including metals.The ores are extracted through mining; these are then refined to extract the valuable element(s).This Collection contains 20 Types of Basic Metallic Ores Specimens.HematiteW.M.Garrison Jr,H.I.Aaronson,in Encyclopedia of Materials: Science and Technology,2001 1 Extractive Metallurgy and Mechanical Processing of Steel Iron ore consists primarily of hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) in proportions which vary appreciably among ore bodies,as well as variously hydrated hematites,siderite (FeCO 3),and pyrite (FeS 2).

## Difference Between Magnetite and Hematite Definition,…
Magnetite and hematite are two forms of iron ores from which iron can be extracted.Magnetite contains iron in the form of Fe 3 O 4.Hematite contains iron in the form of Fe 2 O 3.The main difference between magnetite and hematite is that magnetite is 1.MagnetiteMagnetite is one of the most economically important iron ores.Because it has such a high iron content,magnetic iron ore deposits are highly prized.The iron from magnetite and hematite deposits is the source ore used to create steel used in modern infrastructure (3).

## Hematite: A primary ore of iron and a pigment mineral
What is Hematite? Hematite is one of the most abundant minerals on Earth's surface and in the shallow crust.It is an iron oxide with a chemical composition of Fe 2 O 3.It is a common rock forming mineral found in sedimentary,metamorphic,and igneous rocks at locations throughout the world.Hematite is the most important ore of iron.Although it was once mined at thousands of locations around.Types of Minerals16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Ferrous minerals contain iron while non ferrous minerals do not contain iron.All of the metallic ores such as magnetite,pyrite,bauxite,hematite etc.can be called metallic minerals.Non Metallic Minerals: These minerals do not contain any metals,so they generally have non metallic physical properties.Though we cannot extract metals.
