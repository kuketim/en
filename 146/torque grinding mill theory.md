## Frequency domain characterization of torque in …
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The collisions between particles (both balls and grinding material) and the mill shell generate forces which are directly related,not only with vibration,but also with the mill load torque.As a consequence,it is reasonable to assume that the dampening effect accompanying the variation on the mill filling level give rise to a modification in the spectrum of the torque signal.Vertimill&#174;It is capable of handling feed sizes up to 6 mm and grinding to products less than 20 microns,and has standard mill sizes ranging from 15HP (11kW) to 4500HP (3352 kW).Support from Metso experts.Metso draws from more than 100 years of mill design and manufacturing expertise,and over three decades of successful Vertimill&#174; applications.
