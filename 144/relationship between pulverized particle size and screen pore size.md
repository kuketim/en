## Particle Size Distribution
Particle size and particle size distribution are important to characterize metal powder.The size of a nonspherical particle is often difficult to define.While spherical particles are described by their diameter,irregular particles have to be approximated to an equivalent sphere diameter when automated techniques using light,laser,x ray or other optical methods are used.Particle size distributionThe particle size distribution (PSD) of a powder,or granular material,or particles dispersed in fluid,is a list of values or a mathematical function that defines the relative amount,typically by mass,of particles present according to size.[1] Significant energy is usually required to disintegrate soil,etc.particles into the PSD that is.

## Evaluation of roll compaction as a preparation …
Also,in our study the enlarged particle size by roll compaction seemed to be a main reason for the reduced tablet strength.The particle size of starting powder was 93 μm,while that of roll compacted granules was 710 μm.This increased particle size might lead to lower tablet strength because of reduced surface area available for bonding.Characterization of particles and particle systemsParticle size,in the sense commonly used,is a linear length measure,measured in SI unit [m].In this sense it can be uniquely defined only for spheres,where it is the diameter (or radius).For all other shapes,particle size must be clearly defined via the measuring procedure.
