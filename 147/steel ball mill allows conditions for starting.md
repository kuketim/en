## Ball mill
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles andMicronization of a Soft Material: Air Jet and Micro Ball.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Micronization of Pluronic&#174; F 68 using Cryo Micro Ball Mill.Pluronic&#174; F 68 of different weights (25,50,and 100 mg) were placed into a micro ball mill vessel (Dentsply Rinn Corporation,Elgin,IL,U
