## Gold cyanidation Wikipedia
Gold cyanidation is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low grade ore by converting the gold to a water soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction.Due to the highly poisonous nature of cyanide,the process is controversial and its usage is banned.Cyanide Use in Gold MiningVat (or tank) leaching: The ore is mixed with cyanide solution in large tanks.Although the chances of spills are lower because the leaching process is more controlled,the resulting waste,known as tailings,is stored behind large dams (tailings impoundments.

## Gold extraction
The solubility of gold in a water and cyanide solution was discovered in 1783 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele,but it was not until the late 19th century,that an industrial process was developed.The expansion of gold mining in the Rand of South Africa began to slow down in the 1880s,as the new deposits being found tended to be pyritic ore.Gold CyanidationCyanide &quot;vat leaching&quot; mixes finely crushed ore with a cyanide salt in water.The cyanide binds to the gold ions,and makes them soluble in water,thereby allowing separation from the rock.This process usually takes place inside a mill or other mining facility.
