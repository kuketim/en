(fragmentai rock),sedimentary rock consisting wholly or chiefly of fragments of various rocks (magmatic,metamorphic,or sedimentary) and minerals (quartz,feldspar,mica,and sometimes glauconite and volcanic glass).All these clastic rocks are dominated by coarse grained sandstone and conglomerate,and the clast assemblage in the conglomerate is clearly derived from the plutonic and.5.3: Sedimentary RocksSedimentary rock is classified into two main categories: clastic and chemical.Clastic or detrital sedimentary rocks are made from pieces of bedrock,sediment,derived primarily by mechanical … Grain Size Detrital rock is classified according to sediment grain size,which is graded from large to small on the Wentworth scale (see figure).

## Clastic Sedimentary Rock Classification
Sedimentary rocks are classified on the basis of the texture (grain size) of the rock,and composition.The basic classification only concerned texture,using the Wentworth size scale.But any full rock name must specify both texture and composition.Thus,an arkose sandstone is a rock of sand sized particles,with a high percentage of those particles being feldspar.6.Sedimentary Rocks Flashcards QuizletStart studying 6.Sedimentary Rocks.Learn vocabulary,terms,and more with flashcards,games,and other study tools.
