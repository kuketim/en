## Level measurement in Coal bunkers
Level measurement Hard coal and brown coal are the main energy sources for a coal fired power plant.Delivered by ship or train,the coal is unloaded into bunkers up to 30 m high.The coal is transported to these bunkers from stockpiles at the power plant via conveyer belt systems either over ground or underground.Measuring instrumentIn the past,a common time measuring instrument was the sundial.Today,the usual measuring instruments for time are clocks and watches.For highly accurate measurement of time an atomic clock is used.Stop watches are also used to measure time in some sports.
