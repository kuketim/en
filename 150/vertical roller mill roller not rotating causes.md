In a vertical roller mill,the objects being ground are placed on a large spinning plate.Centrifugal force causes the materials to spread out towards the edges of the plate.As they reach the edges,they are ground down by rollers placed around the perimeter of the plate.Improvements in Newball mill without drying chamber may not be operable 3.Factors affecting ball mills Effect of feed moisture on grindability t h kWh t Feed moisture Use of synthetic waste gypsum or additives can increase the total feed moisture &amp; adversely affect the mill per

## Rolling of hot strip and strip defects IspatGuru
Under high rolling forces,the rolls flatten and bend,and the entire mill is elastically distorted.Mill spring causes the thickness of the strip exiting from the rolling mill to be greater than the roll gap set under no load conditions.Precise thickness rolling requires the elastic constant of the mill…Why is pulverizer grinded mineral fluffy and roller mill.Zhengzhou ShuGuang Heavy Machinery Co.Ltd.Telephone： 67666660 Call： 13523465141 Email：shuguang ballmill@163.com Application range: dry ball mill is also known as dry mill.It is mainly used in powder grinding of finished products.
