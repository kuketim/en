## Raisebore mining
17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The raisebore mining method is an underground mining method to obtain ore,in which a horizontal underground shaft is built below the deposit.A revolving drill called a &quot;reaming head&quot; is input vertically into the deposit which knocks the ore loose and allows it to fall into the collecting vehicle below.This process is used for several mined resources,including uranium.Introduction This paper has been prepared to provide basic information on the activities of the Raw Materials for Nuclear Fuel Cycle Unit of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle and Materials Section of the Division of Nuclear Fuel Cycle and Waste Technology of IAEA and to focus on the fast developing uranium production technology of in situ leach mining.Cameco Corporation Reports Third Quarter Financial …Reports Third Quarter Financial Results by 24hgold 24hgoldDouble Toggle Jaw Crusher Manufacturer,Single Toggle Jaw.About Us Mahavir Engg.Enterprise based in Vadodara,Gujarat,India,is a major manufacturer and supplier of technically advanced range of Double Toggle Jaw Crusher,Single Toggle Jaw Crusher,Laboratory Crusher,Vibrating Screen,Rotary Screen,Vertical &amp; Horizontal Shaft Impactor,Portable Crushing Plant,Belt Conveyor etc.
