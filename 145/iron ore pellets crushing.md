PELLETS Iron ore pellets are the raw materials are formed by mixing fine grain sized ( 0.075 mm) iron ore with bentonite (0.8%),followed by pelletizing and induration processes.Pellets are used in the steel making process by melting in the blast furnaces.DesiredSintering of the pellets of Egyptian iron ore with lime and …iron ore pellets with high basicity (1.17) has been possible without sticking pellets up to 1300 C hardening temperature.(3) The use of lime contents up to 4 wt% (pellet basicity 1.17).
