## Thorium Energy Viability
17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Thorium Energy Alliance estimates &quot;there is enough thorium in the United States alone to power the country at its current energy level for over 1,000 years.&quot; [4] Thorium is safer and more efficient to mine than uranium,thus making it more environmentally friendly.Uranium ore29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Ore genesis.There are several themes of uranium ore deposit formation,which are caused by geological and chemical features of rocks and the element uranium.The basic themes of uranium ore genesis are host mineralogy,reduction oxidation potential,and porosity.Uranium is a highly soluble,as well as a radioactive,heavy metal.

## Thorium in Australia Parliament of Australia
Thorium is found in small quantities in the earth s upper crust where,at 6 10 parts per million,it is about three times more abundant than uranium.The main source of thorium in Australia and worldwide is the mineral monazite which is a reddish brown rare earth phosphate mineral.Monazite contains 8 10 per cent thorium.India Has World's Largest Thorium Reserves,So Why …23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;&gt; India Has World's Largest Thorium Reserves,So Why Can't We Use It As A Source Of Clean Energy?.No.Uranium extracted from the ore is first stored as uranium oxide concentrate,better known as yellow cake,when is then enriched into Uranium isotope,a fuel that can be put as pellets in the nuclear fuel assembly.and about 66 per.

## ATSDR
21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Thorium is a naturally occurring,radioactive metal.Small amounts of thorium are present in all rocks,soil,above ground and underground water,plants,and animals.These small amounts of thorium contribute to the weak background radiation for such substances.Soil commonly contains an average of about 6 parts of thorium per million parts (ppm) of soil.Should Australia consider thorium nuclear power?Thorium has several advantages over uranium nuclear power,but it also has its drawbacks.However,the question remains whether it would be the right technology should Australia choose to go nuclear.

## Uranium mining by country
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Regular production of uranium bearing ore in the United States began in 1898 with the mining of carnotite bearing sandstones of the Colorado Plateau in Colorado and Utah,for their vanadium content.The discovery of radium by Marie Curie,also in 1898,soon made the ore also valuable for radium.Uranium was a byproduct.Thorium reactorsBy contrast thorium,once extracted from its ore,is reactor ready.It does,it is true,need a seed of uranium or plutonium to provide neutrons to start the ball rolling.
