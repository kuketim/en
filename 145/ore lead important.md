## Lead (Galena) Facts
23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Lead is a naturally occurring metallic element usually associated with other ore minerals (primarily those of zinc,silver and copper) such as pyrite,sphalerite,quartz and barite.Trace amounts of other elements including gold are sometimes found with lead ore.The most common ore mineral of lead mined in the United States is galena with the chemical symbol PbS.A Brief History of Lead Properties,Uses and …The most economically important lead ore is called galena.Galena contains lead sulfide (PbS),as well as zinc and silver,all of which can be extracted and refined to produce pure metals.Other ores that are mined for lead include anglesite and cerussite.Nigeria has over 10,000,000 metric tons of lead ore deposits,and to take advantage of this resources,interested investors can mine source and export the product.Types of Lead Ores 1) Galena: The Galena is also called Lead Glance.It is an important source of silver and the most important ore of lead.
