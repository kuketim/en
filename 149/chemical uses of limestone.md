## Limestone in industry Resources,conflicts and.
The uses of limestone in industry.When acid and limestone react,the limestone and the acid change.For example,when limestone (CaCO 3) is added to hydrochloric acid (HCl),they form calcium chloride,water and carbon dioxide:.2HCl + CaCO 3 → CaCl 2 + H 2 O + CO 2.This results in chemical weathering of limestone in nature,but another way of looking at this is that the acid is neutralised.Physical and Chemical Properties of LimestoneSummary This chapter contains sections titled: Physical Properties Chemical Properties Impurities References Physical and Chemical Properties of Limestone Lime and Limestone Wiley Online Library Skip to Article Content

## Michigan Limestone and Chemical Company
25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Michigan Limestone and Chemical Company (a.k.a.&quot;Michigan Limestone&quot;) operates the world's largest limestone quarry located near Rogers City,Michigan.It was founded in 1910; however,production didn't begin until 1912.Ownership of the quarry has changed a number of times in recent years,but it is still one of the country's largest producers of limestone.How does weathering affect limestone?Weathering is the breakdown of rock by physical,chemical or biological processes.Limestone areas are predominantly affected by chemical weathering when rainwater,which contains a weak carbonic acid,reacts with limestone.This causes the limestone to dissolve.Carbon dioxide from the respiration of animals (and ourselves) is one cause of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

## Uses of limestone
Limestone is a type of a sedimentary rock that is found naturally in the earth’s environment.The rock comprises primarily of chemical compound calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) in the form of calcite which is yet again a type of a mineral.It also contains other materials like quartz,clay minerals,pyrite,feldspar,and siderite amongst others.The chemistry of limestone7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The chemical and physical properties of limestone,especially when reasonably pure,make it highly sought after for hundreds of everyday uses.With salt and coal,it formed the main feedstock for the chemical industry until about 1914.
