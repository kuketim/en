## Leaching (metallurgy)
Leaching is a process widely used in extractive metallurgy where ore is treated with chemicals to convert the valuable metals within into soluble salts while impurity remain insoluble.These can then be washed out and processed to give the pure metal; the material left over is commonly referred to as tailings.Cyanide Leaching Chemistry &amp; Gold CyanidationZinc complexes are more likely to cause trouble in the cyanida tion of silver ores because such ores contain much more silver than a gold ore contains gold.Thus,a much larger amount of zinc is required to precipitate the dissolved silver,resulting in cyanide solutions carrying a relatively high per&#173;centage of zinc cyanogen complexes and in some cases zincates.

## Gold Leaching Process
Many opportunities exist throughout the world for small cyanide plants,possibly using a Gold Leaching Process,both for production and pilot operations,especially in areas not easily accessible,and where labor and local costs are on a level for profitable operation.Ores not fully amenable to treatment by amalgamation or flotation processes for the recovery of gold and silver can often be.Processes Free Full Text A Novel Technology for …The leaching of copper and zinc was maximized in the leaching solution at 87.43% and 64.38%,respectively,when leaching time was 1.5 h.This phenomenon was also reported by Zhang et al.[ 26 ],who investigated the effect of leaching time on Co leaching from laterite ore,and the results showed that the leaching extent of Co reached the maximum,and the leaching rate decreased,when the.
