## Nanoparticle
6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A nanoparticle or ultrafine particle is usually defined as a particle of matter that is between 1 and 100 nanometres (nm) in diameter.The term is sometimes used for larger particles,up to 500 nm,[citation needed] or fibers and tubes that are less than 100 nm in only two directions.At the lowest range,metal particles smaller than 1 nm are usually called atom clusters instead.High energy ball milling technique for ZnO nanoparticles.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;During the milling operation,two essential processes affect the particle characteristics.22 First,the cold welding process leads to an increase in average particle size of the composite.The seco
