## Flotation of Pyrite
2020 2 29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Sodium silicate was somewhat effective in causing a differential or selective flotation of copper,as chalcopyrite from pyrite by keeping pyrite from floating.Sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide gave,in most cases,a distinct separation of sphalerite from chalcopyrite; i.e.a high copper and low zinc by suppressing the flotation of sphalerite.Processes Free Full Text Recovering Cobalt and …Nevertheless,as the geological conditions and mineral composition of each deposit are different,the flotation process of pyrite is also different.Tieshanhe iron ore in Jiyuan occurs in the hydrothermal deposit of dolomite related to diorite metasomatism.Gangue minerals are mainly tremolite,actinolite,calcite,dolomite,and chlorite.
