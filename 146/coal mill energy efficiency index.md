## Vertical Roller Mills
When it comes to grinding raw coal,savings in specific energy consumption can be achieved with vertical roller mills.Specific energy consumption depends on the grindability of the raw coal and the coal meal fineness required.A dynamic separator that ensures high separation efficiency also helps to reduce specific energy use.Coal Student EnergyCoal is classified into four main types,or ranks,based on carbon and heat content.The general rule is that the higher the grade of coal,the cleaner it burns and the more versatile its uses.

## Coal explained
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Coal takes millions of years to form.Coal is a combustible black or brownish black sedimentary rock with a high amount of carbon and hydrocarbons.Coal is classified as a nonrenewable energy source because it takes millions of years to form.Coal contains the energy stored by plants that lived hundreds of millions of years ago in swampy forests.Heat of combustionThe heating value (or energy value or calorific value) of a substance,usually a fuel or food (see food energy),is the amount of heat released during the combustion of a specified amount of it.The calorific value is the total energy released as heat when a substance undergoes complete combustion with oxygen under standard conditions.The chemical reaction is typi

## Coal mill optimisation in coal fired power.
This is all controlled by the coal mill or pulveriser,and its associated feeder equipment.Operation of the coal mill can affect the ramp rate of the power station and its ability to handle rapid changes in output.For coal fired power plants,the response time of the coal mills is critical for the overall reaction time to changing demand.
