## Ball Milling
Ball milling of graphite with appropriate stabilizers is another mode of exfoliation in liquid phase.21 Graphite is ground under high sheer rates with millimeter sized metal balls causing exfoliation to graphene (Fig.2.5),under wet or dry conditions.For instance,this method can be employed to produce nearly 50 g of graphene in the absence of any oxidant.22 Graphite (50 g) was ground in.Ball MillMixer Mills grind and homogenize small sample volumes quickly and efficiently by impact and friction.These ball mills are suitable for dry,wet and cryogenic grinding as well as for cell disruption for DNA RNA recovery.Planetary Ball Mills meet and exceed all requirements for fast and reproducible grinding to analytical fineness.They are.
