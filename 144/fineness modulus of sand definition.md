## Fineness financial definition of fineness
A measure of the purity of a precious metal as a unit of 1,000.That is,a fineness measure of 1 means that 0.1% of a substance is a given precious metal,while a measure of 1,000 means that 100% is the metal.Fineness is important to commodities and futures involving precious metals,in which the quality of the underlying metals must be specified in the contract.CRD C 80 Method of Calculation of the Fineness …27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;METHOD OF CALCULATION OF THE FINENESS MODULUS OF AGGREGATE 1.Definition 1.1 The standard definition of fineness modulus is as follows: “An empirical factor obtained by adding the total percentages of a sample of the aggregate retained on each of a specified series of sieves,and dividing the sum by 100.” Note.
