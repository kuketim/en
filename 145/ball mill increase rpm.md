## Page 1 Ball Milling Theory
Once you know the ideal speed of rotation for your mill jars,you will need to design your mill around this critical parameter.With most ball mill designs,you have two areas of speed reduction to tweak: from the motor drive shaft to the drive pulley andBall MillThe ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40%.
