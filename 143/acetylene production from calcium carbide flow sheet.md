## Acetylene Faq
Calcium carbide reacts with water to form Acetylene as per the following reaction : CaC2 + 2H2O = C2H2 + Ca(OH)2 + 27,000 Calories.As you may see from the above reaction,The Calcium Carbide (CaC2) breaks down upon contacting with water molecules (2H2O) to form Acetylene gas (C2H2 ) with Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)2 referred to as slurry discharge) and this process releases heat as a result of.Technology Profile: Calcium Carbide Production from …Calcium carbide is the most industrially relevant carbide because of its important role as the basis of the acetylene industry.In locations where there is a shortage of petroleum,calcium carbide is used as the starting material for the production of acetylene,which,in turn,can be used as a building block for a range of organic chemicals,such as vinyl acetate,acetaldehyde and acetic acid.

## Acetylene Plant Manufacturer
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Our company commenced manufacturing of acetylene producing plants at its production unit in New Delhi in 1985.The designs and drawings along with the technology of our plants were based on the process cycle of Linde &amp; Claude which had been incepted by Dr.Boschi of Italy through its company ING.L.Acetylen Gas Cylinder Feeling Flow Sheet.AcetyleneAcetylene is not especially toxic,but when generated from calcium carbide,it can contain toxic impurities such as traces of phosphine and arsine,which give it a distinct garlic like smell.It is also highly flammable,as are most light hydrocarbons,hence its use in welding.

## How acetylene is made
10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;before the calcium carbide has completely cooled,or in an inert atmosphere.The calcium carbide product is used primarily in generating acetylene and in desulfurizing iron.11.4.2 Emissions And Controls Emissions from calcium carbide manufacturing include particulate matter (PM),sulfur oxides (SOx),CO,CO2,and hydrocarbons.Particulate.ACETYLENE GAS PLANTAcetylene is an endothermic compound,its heat of formation being nearly 50kg. cal.g.mol.Both the gas (tc,37&#194;&#176;; Pc,62 atm.) and the liquid (b.p.83.6&#194;&#176;) are highly explosive,particularly under pressure.Acetylene is a colourless inflammable gas obtained by the action of water on calcium carbide.

## CHEMICALS USED IN ACETYLENE PRODUCTION
Applications of carbide.Production of acetylene: One of the main applications of the chemical is creation of acetylene.Friedrich Wohler discovered that the reaction of calcium carbide with water generates acetylene and calcium hydroxide in 1862.CaC2 + 2 H2O &gt; C2H2 + Ca(OH)2Acetylene production4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Acetylene (useful for oxy acetylene welding) is produced by reacting Calcium carbide (CaC2) with water.Calcium carbide is generated by the carbothermic reduction of lime (CaO) at 2000C.Lime can be produced by reducing limestone (calcium carbonate) in a furnace at 900C C.
