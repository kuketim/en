## Manufacturing Process
SUMMARY OF THE PROCESS FOR ZEOLITE The materials used in Zeolite are minerals mined from our Bromely deposit southwest of Princeton,BC,Canada.The material is hauled by truck from the mine about 180km to the plant at 714 Sarcee Street East,Kamloops,BC,Canada.Bear River ZeoliteBear River Zeolite (BRZ™) is almost 90 to 95% pure clinoptilolite and contains: Approximately 3.5% potassium,a plant nutrient Approximately 2.02% calcium,a pH buffer for animals and soils
