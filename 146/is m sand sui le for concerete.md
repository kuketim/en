## How to Fill Voids Under a Concrete Slab Hunker
Concrete slabs can develop voids from a variety of reasons,ranging from sliding soil beneath the slab displaced because of a lack of proper compression,to water erosion slowly washing away the soil over time.Voids can lead to a weakness in the slab,causing dips in the surface,tilting or cracks and breaks.Self compacting concrete has been used in bridges and even on pre cast sections.One of the most remarkable projects built using self compacting concrete is the Akashi Kaikyo Suspension Bridge.In this project,the SCC was mixed on site and pumped through a piping system to the specified point,located 200 meters away.Mix Design For M35 Grade Of ConcreteThe mix design for M35 Grade Of Concrete for pile foundations provided here is for reference purpose only.Actual site conditions vary and thus this should be adjusted as per the location and other factors.Alibaba.com offers 14,954 concrete spray machines products.About 45% of these are mortar spray machines,29% are shotcrete machine,and 4% are concrete pumps.A wide variety of concrete spray machines options are available to you,such as free samples,paid samples.
