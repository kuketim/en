## Gold extraction Wikipedia
The solubility of gold in a water and cyanide solution was discovered in 1783 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele,but it was not until the late 19th century,that an industrial process was developed.The expansion of gold mining in the Rand of South Africa began to slow down in the 1880s,as the new deposits being found tended to be&nbsp;.Gold Extraction Universal Bio MiningUniversal Bio Mining has developed a patent pending biochemical process to modify this organic matter.By changing the surface characteristics of the contaminating material,its binding properties are reduced.The basic biochemistry can be applied in to manners: as a pre treatment to improve the recovery of gold in&nbsp;.

## Environmentally friendly gold recovery CSIRO
6 Dec 2016.We have developed a safe gold recovery process that avoids the use of cyanide.The novel gold recovery process replaces cyanide with thiosulphate a non‑toxic chemical helping to reduce the risks and environmental impact of gold processing operations.Thiosulphate is effective at picking up gold in&nbsp;.Gold mining WikipediaThe technique using dissolution with alkaline cyanide has been highly developed over recent years.It is particularly appropriate for low grade gold and silver ore processing (e.g.less than 5 ppm gold) but its use is not restricted to such ores.There are many environmental hazards associated with this extraction method,&nbsp;.
