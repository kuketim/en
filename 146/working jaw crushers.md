## Jaw crusher
 · • Working Principle Of A Jaw Crusher • A jaw crusher uses compressive force for breaking of particle.• A Jaw Crusher reduces large size rocks or ore by placing the rock into compression.A fixed jaw,mounted in a "V" alignment is the stationary breaking surface,while the movable jaw exerts force on the rock by forcing it against the.Working Principle of CrushersGyratory crushers work on a similar principle to jaw crushers but have a circular gap.Rock is compressed between a static conical bowl and a concave mantle which oscillates about the central axis.These are generally designed for primary crushing in large scale rock crushing applications up to 6000 t h.

## Jaw Crusher Working Principle
A Jaw Crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant.The size of a jaw crusher is designated by the rectangular or square opening at the top of the jaws (feed opening).For instance,a 24 x 36 jaw crusher has a opening of 24&quot; by 36&quot;,a 56 x 56 jawHow to solve the Problem of Jaw Crusher Flywheel.Because the jaw crusher is intermittent working,divided into work stroke and idling stroke,resulting in the motor load imbalance.In order to balance the load,the energy of the idle stroke is accumulated when the moving jaw leaves the fixed jaw,so that the energy can be fully released during the working stroke.
