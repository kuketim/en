## Mitigating Alkali Silica Reaction
What is Alkali Silica Reaction? Alkali silica reaction (ASR) is a chemical reaction between the alkalis in portland cement and certain types of silica minerals present in some aggregates.The reaction product is a hygroscopic gel,which absorbs moisture and swells.Under certain circumstances,the formation of the gel can cause expansion and,eventually,cracking of the concrete.The alkali silica reaction (ASR),is the reaction of reactive silica in concrete aggregates and solution of hydroxyl ions within concrete voids.This reaction causes the formation of a gel which expands with the effect of moisture in concrete.The increase in volume due to the swelling leads to cracks in the concrete.Standard Test Method for Determination of Length Change of4.1 Alkalisilica reaction is a chemical interaction between some siliceous constituents of concrete aggregates and hydroxyl ions (1).6 The concentration of hydroxyl ion within the concrete is predominantly controlled by the concentration of sodium and potassium (2).
