## Mill (grinding)
Ball mill.A typical type of fine grinder is the ball mill.A slightly inclined or horizontal rotating cylinder is partially filled with balls,usually stone or metal,which grind material to the necessary fineness by friction and impact with the tumbling balls.Ball mills normally operate with an approximate ball charge of 30%.Mill Steel Charge Volume CalculationWe can calculate the steel charge volume of a ball or rod mill and express it as the % of the volume within the liners that is filled with grinding media.While the mill is stopped,the charge volume can be gotten by measuring the diameter inside the liners and the distance from the top of the charge to the top of the mill.
