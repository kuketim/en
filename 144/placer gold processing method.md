## Placer Mining Methods
The word placer is thought to have come from Catalan and Spanish,meaning a shoal or sand bar.The word entered the American vocabulary during the 1848 California Gold Rush,and when gold was discovered in Alaska and the Canadian Klondike in the late 1890s,the gold seekers who rushed northward brought with them various placer mining technologies.Placer miningPlacer mining ˈ p l &#230; s ər is the mining of stream bed deposits for minerals.This may be done by open pit (also called open cast mining) or by various surface excavating equipment or tunnelling equipment.Placer mining is frequently used for precious metal deposits (particularly gold) and gemstones,both of which are often found in alluvial deposits—deposits of sand and gravel in.
