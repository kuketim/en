## What is a vertical mill
What is the difference between vertical mill and ball mill? The vertical roller mill allows a large amount of air to be passed,so the drying capacity is large; the material in the grinding is in a suspended state,which increases the contact area between the material and the airflow,and the heat exchange condition is good,so the drying efficiency is high.Face millingThis type of machining is called High Speed Machining (HSM).In milling short chipping materials,such as grey cast iron,a face milling cutter with an extra close pitch can be used,resulting in high table feed.In HRSA materials where cutting speed is normally low,an extra close pitch results in a high table feed.
