## Solids and Metals Specific Gravities
The Specific Gravity SG is a dimensionless unit defined as the ratio of density of the material to the density of water at a specified temperature.It is common to use the density of water at 4 o C (39 o F) as reference at this point the density of water is at the highest.Specific gravities SG for common solids and metals can be found in the table below:Specific Gravity Of Metals TableThe specific gravity of all other materials are compared to water as a fraction heavier or fraction lighter density,no matter how small or large the fraction is.For example,beryllium has a specific gravity (sg) of 1.84 (1840 kg m&#179;).As specific gravity is just a comparison,it can be applied across any units.

## Nickel Specific Heat Capacity Periodic Table
Specific heat of Nickel is 0.44 J g K.Specific heat,or specific heat capacity,is a property related to internal energy that is very important in thermodynamics.The intensive properties c v and c p are defined for pure,simple compressible substances as partial derivatives of the internal energy u(T,v) and enthalpy h(T,p),respectively:Difference Between Density and Specific GravityThey are not,however,identical measures.Specific gravity is an expression of density in relation to the density of a standard or reference (usually water).Also,density is expressed in units (weight relative to size) while specific gravity is a pure number or dimensionless.

## Density & Specific Gravity Some Meteorite Information.
Just as useful as density,however,is the specific gravity.Specific gravity is the ratio of the mass (weight) of a rock to the mass of the same volume of water.Water has a density of 1.0 g cm 3,so the numeric value of specific gravity for a rock is the same as that for density.Because specific gravity is a ratio,it has no unit.Lateritic nickel ore deposits WikipediaThis ore is so rich in limonite (generally grading 47% to 59% iron,0.8 to 1.5% nickel and trace cobalt) that it is essentially similar to low grade iron ore.As such,certain steel smelters in China have developed a process for blending nickel limonite ore with conventional iron ore to …

## Nonferrous Slags
Nickel Slag Air cooled nickel slag is brownish black in color.It crushes to angular particles but has a smooth,glassy texture.The specific gravity of air cooled nickel slag may be as high as 3.5 (15),while the absorption is quite low (0.37 percent).(3) The unit weight of nickel slag is somewhat higher than that of conventional aggregate.Mineral Deposit Value How to Calculate the Potential.Before you can calculate the potential mineral deposit value,you first need to gather some specific data regarding the ore body and the individual drill results.This required data can be found in the mining company’s press releases in which they announce their drill results.Make sure that this data is announced according to the guidelines of National Instrument 43 101 (i.e.approved by a.
