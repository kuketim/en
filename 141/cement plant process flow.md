## Cement Manufacturing Process: What is Cement made of
Methods of Manufacturing Process of Cement At present Portland Cement is manufactured by two processes,Dry Process,and Wet Process The main difference between these two methods of manufacturing of cement is that in the dry process,calcareous and argillaceous raw materials are fed into the burning kilns in a perfectly dry stateWhat Is The Batching Plant Process?Apr 21,2020&#0183;&#32;The flow process for batching plants begin when the aggregates are fed into separate bins These aggregates are weighed separately as required by the control panel’s design set After they are weighed,they are moved to the mixing area Above this are weigh hoppers for the water,additives,and cement
