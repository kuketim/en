## good metals to make knives from? BladeForums.com
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;If you want cheap steel to practice forging techniques or grinding techniques,just get plain old mild steel.if you are looking to make a heat treated knife,get a known steel,I would suggest 1075,1095,or W2 to start.when you break it down,none of these steels should be more than $1.00 for a hunter utility,especially if you are forging.IDENTIFYING,CUTTING,FILING,SHAPING,AND DRILLING …spark test can easily be performed on most metals.This test involves lightly holding the metal against a grinding wheel and observing the characteristics of the spark stream.As carbon in the metal unites with oxygen in the air,it begins to burn; therefore,the more carbon the metal contains,the greater the amount of sparks will be observed.

&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;When grinding knives,the plain carbon steels spark a lot,and an experienced eye can judge from the spark pattern the type of steel it is! Stainless steels can spark,but from my experiences of grinding C and ATS (and other steels just in sharpening),they don't spark that much.They don't spark at all in sharpening as per my methods.Spark Test SteelMedium carbon steel This steel has more forking than mild steel and a wide variety of spark lengths,with more near the grinding wheel.High carbon steel High carbon steel has a bushy spark pattern (lots of forking) that starts at the grinding wheel.The sparks are not as bright as the medium carbon steel ones.Manganese steel

## cast steel to mild steel?
Grinding spark test is the easiest way &amp; quickest.2006,11:22 AM.Originally posted by maddmatt.I need to weld cast steel to mild steel,what process should i use? what filler rod should I use ? or does it need to be brased? Matt,You really need to know exactly what casting alloy you are welding.Some are low carbon steels like a.Material determination using spark observationsteel specimen and the grinding wheel.By attaching a custom built arm to the eight inch bench grinder,the force on the grinding wheel was kept at a constant force of 3.3 Newtons.This meant that any variation in the spark stream would be due to a variation in the steel cast iron instead of the force applied to the specimens.
