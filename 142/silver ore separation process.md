Crushing process: silver ore beneficiation begins with the milling of extracted ore in preparation for further activities to recover silver values.Milling operations are designed to produce uniform size particles by crushing,grinding,and wet or dry classification.Milling is a multistaged process and it can be divided into primary crushing,secondary crushing and fine crushing.Patio processThe patio process is a process for extracting silver from ore.The process was invented by Bartolom&#233; de Medina in Pachuca,Mexico,in 1554.[1] The patio process was the first process to use mercury amalgamation to recover silver from ore.It replaced smelting as the primary method of extracting silver from ore at Spanish colonies in the.
