The results of experiments on a 40 cm &#215; 40 cm grate discharge ball mill have been analysed for variation of mill hold up weight of solids with solids feed rate,weight percent solids,mean feed particle size,material specific gravity and work index.mean piece weight of grinding mediaBall Mill an overview ScienceDirect Topics The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.
