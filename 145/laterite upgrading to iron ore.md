## Laterite
Laterite is a soil and rock type rich in iron and aluminium and is commonly considered to have formed in hot and wet tropical areas.Nearly all laterites are of rusty red coloration,because of high iron oxide content.They develop by intensive and prolonged weathering of the underlying parent rock.Recovery of Magnetite from Leached Laterite residue by.the iron from laterite ore without nickel included.One of the most signiﬁcant factors in the application of laterite ore into iron making is the increase of iron content and reduction of its impurities as low as described above.In this work,a wet low intensity magnetic separator will be applied to upgrade low grade iron of laterite ore.

## Upgrading low nickel content laterite ores using …
The processing of nickel laterite ore to produce ferronickel is energy intensive,especially when low nickel content ores are processed.The selective reduction beneficiation of laterite ore to produce high nickel content nickeliferous concentrate and abandon gangue minerals before smelting potentially offers an effective pre treatment to this process.Laterite geology BritannicaLaterite,soil layer that is rich in iron oxide and derived from a wide variety of rocks weathering under strongly oxidizing and leaching conditions.It forms in tropical and subtropical regions where the climate is humid.Lateritic soils may contain clay minerals; but they tend to be silica poor,for silica is leached out by waters passing through the soil.

Abstract.Methods of upgrading fine grained iron ores are reviewed — a fine grained ore deposit defined as one with mineral matter so finely disseminated within the gangue matrix that crushing and grinding,to effect liberation,only produce ‘fines’ that respond poorly to conventional beneficiation processes.gravity separation of nickel laterite oregravity separation of nickel laterite ore.For example in a nickelcobalt laterite deposit in New South Wales Australia gravity separation followed by magnetic separation resulted in upgrading nickel from 09 to 11 at 57 recovery Furthermore Muir and Johnson 2006 demonstrated that in physical
