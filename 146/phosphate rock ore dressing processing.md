## Mineral processing
Dewatering is an important process in mineral processing.The purpose of dewatering is to remove water absorbed by the particles which increases the pulp density.This is done for a number of reasons,specifically,to enable ore handling and concentrates to be transported easily,allow further processing to occur and to dispose of the gangue.process of mining phosphatePhosphate Mining Process Line Xinhai.According to different ore properties of phosphate,Xinhai designs many processes for it such as flotation,gravity separation,stone leaching,combined dressing,photoelectric sorting,etc.Flotation is widely used in phosphate including direct flotation,reverse flotation,reverse flotation and flotation,and double reverse flotation process.
