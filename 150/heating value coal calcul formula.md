## Energy value of coal
The energy value of coal,or the fuel content,is the amount of potential energy in coal that can be converted into actual heating ability.The value can be calculated and compared with different grades of coal or even other materials.Materials of different grades will produce differing amounts of heat for a given mass.While chemistry.Formulas for calculating the heating value of coal and coal …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;A new five term formula for calculating the heating value of coal from its carbon,hydrogen,sulfur and ash content was obtained by regression analysis of data on 775 samples of US coals of all ranks.The standard deviation of the calculated value from the observed value …

## How do I calculate higher heating value of syngas …
I need to calculate higher heating value of syngas produced from gasification.following are the methods i have taken from literature some thesis.HHV = (30.18&#215;CO + 30.52&#215;H2 + 9.5&#215; CH4.Net Calorific ValueSolid biomass fuels are more costly than coal,oil,and natural gas,even when compared on a simple gross calorific value (GCV) or net calorific value (NCV) basis.The cost disadvantage of solid biofuels is accentuated by the lower comparative efficiency of use in power generation,in synthesis gas production,and in direct heating systems.
