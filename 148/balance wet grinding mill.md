## Dry Grinding VS Wet Grinding
Dry Grinding VS Wet Grinding.Previous Next.Furthermore the throughput of a continuous feed mill is greater in wet grinding; probably due to the better flow properties of a pulp in comparison with a dry material.It appears,however,that the rate of ball and liner wear is greater in wet milling so the decision between wet and dry operation.Ethanol ProductionEthanol Production Dry versus Wet Grind Processing Traditionally,ethanol from corn has primarily been produced through dry and wet milling processes.The majority of U.S.ethanol production is from dry grind technology.The traditional dry grind process grinds the whole corn kernel and mixes it with water and enzymes.
