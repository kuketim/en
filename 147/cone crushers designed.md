## Cone Crusher
Cone crushers were originally designed and developed by Symons around 1920 and therefore are often described as Symons cone crushers.As the mechanisms of crushing in these crushers are similar to gyratory crushers their designs are similar,but in this case the spindle is supported at the bottom of the gyrating cone instead of being suspended as in larger gyratory crushers.Cone Crusher DesignWhen the Symons brothers invented the cone crusher over 60 years ago,they employed the principle wherein the length of the crushing stroke was related to the free fall of material by gravity.This permitted the material being crushed to fall vertically in the crushing chamber; and in effect caused the particles to be crushed in a series of steps or stages as the particles got …
