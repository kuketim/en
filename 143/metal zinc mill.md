## Steel mill
A steel mill or steelworks is an industrial plant for the manufacture of steel.It may be an integrated steel works carrying out all steps of steelmaking from smelting iron ore to rolled product,but may also describe plants where steel semi finished casting products (blooms,ingots,slabs,billets) are made,from molten pig iron or from scrap.Froth flotationFroth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing,paper recycling and waste water treatment industries.Historically this was first used in the mining industry,where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.
