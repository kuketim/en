## leaching tank gold
Gold cyanidation Wikipedia.Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low grade ore by converting the gold to a water soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold …Gold Leaching Plant (CIL plant)Leaching and adsorption: pump slurry ore into the double impellers leaching tanks,there are always 8 tanks working togheter; add cyanide solution into first one or two leaching tanks,add activated carbon into the rest gold leaching tanks; activated carbon adsorb gold and become the loaded gold carbon,the loaded gold carbon lift into the.
