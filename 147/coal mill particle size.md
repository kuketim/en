## Effects of Mill Performance on Unburnt Carbon in Coal.
However,the combustion performance,in terms of the rear pass temperature,is not widely related to the coal particle size and coal mass flow distribution (in the pulverized coal (PC) pipes) [4].The particulate size affects the heat release rate and subsequently affects the distribution of temperature.Coal assayParticle size distribution.The particle size distribution of milled coal depends partly on the rank of the coal,which determines its brittleness,and on the handling,crushing and milling it has undergone.Generally coal is utilised in furnaces and coking ovens at a certain size,so the crushability of the coal must be determined and its.
