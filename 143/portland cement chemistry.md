## What is Cement? History Chemistry Industries Civil.
Cement Chemistry.Cement is chiefly of two kinds based on the way it is set and hardened: hydraulic cement,which hardens due to the addition of water,and non hydraulic cement,which is hardened by carbonation with the carbon present in the air,so it cannot be used underwater.Portland CementHowever,it is a portland cement’s chemical properties that determine its physical properties and how it cures.Therefore,a basic understanding of portland cement chemistry can help one understand how and why it behaves as it does.This section briefly describes the basic chemical composition of a typical portland cement and how it hydrates.

## What is Cement? History
Cement Chemistry.Cement is chiefly of two kinds based on the way it is set and hardened: hydraulic cement,which hardens due to the addition of water,and non hydraulic cement,which is hardened by carbonation with the carbon present in the air,so it cannot be used underwater.Portland cement clinkerPortland cement clinker overview.Portland cement clinker is a dark grey nodular material made by heating ground limestone and clay at a temperature of about 1400 &#176;C 1500 &#176;C.The nodules are ground up to a fine powder to produce cement,with a small amount of gypsum added to control the setting properties.This page gives a thumbnail sketch.

## Cement composition and classification
A slurry of Portland cement in water is used in wells because it can be pumped easily and hardens readily,even under water.It is called Portland cement because its inventor,Joseph Aspdin,thought the solidified cement resembled stone quarried on the Isle of Portland off the coast of England.CementC.David Lawrence,in Lea's Chemistry of Cement and Concrete (Fourth Edition),1998Portland cement Portland cement (BS 12: 1996) is a factory produced binder general purpose Portland cement made by grinding Portland cement clinker together with a controlled amount of calcium sulfate (≤3.5 per cent SO 3) and up to 5 per cent additional inorganic mineral,e.g.fly ash or limestone.
