## Difference between Volcanic Rocks and Plutonic Rocks.
Volcanic rocks are igneous rocks which form from lava,molten rock which has been thrust out of a volcano onto the surface of a rocky body such as an asteroid,planet,or dwarf planet.Volcanic rocks are fine grained and are found on most terrestrial planetary bodies in our solar system.Formation.I*the Stuhini volcanics.The rocks are dominated by a sequence of basic to intermediate volcanic pyroclaetics,epiclastics and minor flows with 8ome local feleic sequences.Within this sequence occur shallow water limestones as well as some local non volcanic clastic rocks.Rocks in the area generally trend northwest and dip northeast at 450.

## Clastic rock
Clastic rocks are composed of fragments,or clasts,of pre existing minerals and rock.A clast is a fragment of geological detritus,chunks and smaller grains of rock broken off other rocks by physical weathering.Geologists use the term clastic with reference to sedimentary rocks as well as to particles in sediment transport whether in suspension or as bed load,and in sediment …Fragmental volcaniclastic igneous rock and sediment.Clastic rocks and sediments with mostly volcanic derived clasts,containing at least 25% by volume of pyroclastic fragments.Volcaniclastic rocks and sediments were defined by Fisher (1961) and redefined in Fisher and Smith (1991) to include any natural materials composed in part or entirely of volcanic fragments,formed by any particle forming mechanism (e.g.pyroclastic,…
