Thank you for the response,i have selected the aggregate and its gradation,i have took 40mm (down gauge),20mm,10mm,sand and filler material for my design of DBM,i,The Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete Concrete is a mixture of cementious material,aggregate,and water.Aggregate is commonly considered inert filler,which accounts for 60 to 80 percent of the volume and 70 to 85 percent of the weight of concrete.
