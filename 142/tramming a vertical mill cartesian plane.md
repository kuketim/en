## Coordinate Geometry
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;A Cartesian plane,named after the mathematician Rene Descartes,is a plane with a rectangular coordinate system that associates each point in the plane,with an ordered pair.The horizontal line.Unit 2: CNC Machine Tool Programmable Axes and Position.Cartesian coordinates allow one to specify the location of a point in the plane,or in three dimensional space.The Cartesian coordinates or rectangular coordinates system of a point are a pair of numbers (in two dimensions) or a triplet of numbers (in three dimensions) that specified signed distances from the coordinate axis.
