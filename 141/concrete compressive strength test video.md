Compressive strength of concrete is the resistance provided by concrete when a compressive load is applied to it.Concrete has very high compressive strength.Most of the design of concrete structures is done by adopting the value of its compressive strength.Generally,concrete is used for the member of compressive strength because:What Do You Do With Test Results? Concrete Construction.“The strength of concrete is satisfactory provided that the criteria of 1.6.6.1.a and 1.6.6.1.b are met.1.6.6.1.a: Every average of three consecutive strength tests equals or exceeds the specified compressive strength f´c.1.6.6.1.b: No strength test result falls below f´c by more than 500 psi when f´c is 5000 psi or less,or by more than.

## Procedure for Concrete Compression Test Concrete …
Standard Test Method for Compressive Strength of Cylindrical Concrete Specimens (ASTM Designation: A 370 03) This test method consists of applying a compressive axial load to cylinders at a rate which is within the prescribed range until failure occurs.ThePortland Cement Compressive StrengthThe most common strength test,compressive strength,is carried out on a 50 mm ( inch) cement mortar test specimen.The test specimen is subjected to a compressive load (usually from a hydraulic machine) until failure.This loading sequence must take no less.

 · Method: To complete a penetration resistance test,a device drives a small pin or probe into the surface of the concrete.The force used to penetrate the surface,and the depth of the hole,is correlated to the strength of the in place concrete.Pros: Relatively easy to use and can be done directly onsite.Cons: Data is significantly affected by surface conditions as well as the type of form.
