## Cement kiln
Cement kilns are used for the pyroprocessing stage of manufacture of Portland and other types of hydraulic cement,in which calcium carbonate reacts with silica bearing minerals to form a mixture of calcium silicates.Over a billion tonnes of cement are made per year,and cement kilns are the heart of this production process: their capacity usually defines the capacity of the cement plant.
