## Process development metallurgical studies for gold.
In recent years the gold mining industry has been challenged by declining metal prices as well as having to treat ores that have low grades and are refractory in nature.Many factors must be considered when metallurgical studies are designed to develop process design criteria for these type of ores.These factors are mostly related to the mineralogical and chemical compositions of the ores.
