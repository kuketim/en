The system is designed for the removal of iron particles and tea particles carrying iron particles.The system is designed to process a max of 4500 kg of tea in one hour.The output quality of the tea processed through this machine is required to give 30 ppm of remnant pure iron or 400 ppm of iron + tea.Magnetic Coolant Separator Iron Ore Wet Magnetic …&#183; Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron.Since 1849,a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA,and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.

## Iron Ore
The ratio in the output from the three main pelletizing technologies changes depending on practical circumstances,such as iron ore reserves,iron ore types,market demand,and required investment.The ratio for grate kiln pellets has increased to 55.33% in 2011 from 7.21% in 2000,while the ratio for shaft furnace pellets has dropped to 42.05% in 2011 from 68.95% in 2000 in China (see Figure.New dry iron ore processing technology developedThe ore is then separated magnetically using a magnetic separation unit (FDMS).The drying process increases particle segregation,with the technology’s air classifier able to separate particle.
