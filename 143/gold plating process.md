## Hard Gold Plating vs.ENIG Differences and Advantages
The hard plating process features a refined grain surface and harder deposits that emerge from the gold itself being alloyed with a different element — like iron,nickel or cobalt.ENIG plating,or “electroless nickel immersion gold” plating,is much closer to pure gold in that no other elements are used for alloy — making the ENIG plating softer than hard plating.Gold PlatingThe plating process starts with a gold strike treatment to prevent the exchange reaction.The same strike bath can be used for the first rinse after the gold plating.The current density depends a lot on the processing method; that is,0.2 0.4 Adm −2 is used for barrel plating and 0.5 1 Adm −2 for rack plating.

## Soft Gold Plating
However,this process diffuses Nickel into Gold,rendering the Gold harder,making it more difficult to bond wires.Therefore,the conventional plating approach is not suitable for generating robust Gold wire bonding pads.Therefore,manufacturers use a selective plating process for electroplating metal using Titan as a conducting layer.Gold PlatingHu et al.in 2008 [114] developed a simple and environmentally friendly electroless plating solution of chloroauric acid (HAuCl 4) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) for depositing gold film onto ( aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (APTMS) coated glass surface.The plating bath is an aqueous solution containing 10 mL of 0.01% HAuCl 4 and 500 μL of 30% H 2 O 2,which was agitated continuously to.
