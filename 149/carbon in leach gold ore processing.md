## Gold CIL Production Line
Gold CIL Production Line Process Introduction.CIL (Carbon in Leach) process is the most efficient method to leaching and recovering gold from gold ore,The most protruding features is that leaching and adsorption are carried out at the same time,which greatly saves the cost of construction and operation.The leaching and adsorption behaviour of gold ores5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;and seven carbon in leach tanks.The effect of processing the oxide and sulphide ores studied was examined and the model shown to satisfactorily describe the extraction of gold from the Telfer oxide ore.A sensitivity analysis of the effect of process changes on this ore was then undertaken,where the correct operating response to preg robbing

## Activated Carbon Leaching Cil cip Gold Processing …
Gold absorbs onto the activated carbon,which flows countercurrent to the pulp,while screens separate the barren pulp from the gold loaded carbon.Carbon in leach (CIL) is a simultaneous leach and absorption process.The simultaneous leach and absorption phases of the CIL process were developed for processing gold ores that contain preg.Gold Leaching Carbon in Leach18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Gold Leaching( carbon in leach) process is widely used in the newly built gold leaching plants in recent years,and a lot of plants are changing into CIL as well.Gold Leaching CIL process is suitable for the treatment of oxidized gold ore with low sulfur content and mud content.It is unsuitable for the gold ore with high grade silver.
