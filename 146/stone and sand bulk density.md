## Bulk Density Measurement Fact Sheets soilqualityorgau
Bulk density is the weight of soil in a given volume Soils with a bulk density higher than 16 g cm3 tend to restrict root growth Bulk density increases with compaction and tends to increase with depth Sandy soils are more prone to high bulk density Bulk density can be used to calculate soil properties per unit area (eg kg ha)Density of AggregateBulk Density = Mass volume.Key Features: If the volume is unit then,Bulk Density= Mass.Unit in kg m 3 or lb ft 3.In this definition,the volume is that contain both the aggregates and the voids between aggregates particles.The approximate bulk density of aggregate that is commonly used in normal weight concrete is between 1750 kg m.
