## Leaching
The leaching reactor (Figure 1),with a volume of 343 mL,was equipped with a rotating perforated drum,immersed in the leaching solution,which contained the copper samples.All experiments were performed over a period of 2 h at room temperature using waste copper wires of approximately 4 g.The leaching solutions were prepared by using analytic grade chemicals (FeCl 3,HCl and Na 2 S 2 O 8.Processing of Nickel Laterite Ores on the RiseTraditionally,nickel has been processed from sulfide ores in an approach similar to copper processing,in which the ore is upgraded to concentrates and then smelted.As sulfide ore resources dwindle,however,processing of lateritic nickel ores is becoming of greater necessity,with many recognizing nickel laterite ores as the future of the nickel industry.
