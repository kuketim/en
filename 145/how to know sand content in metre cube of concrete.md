## How to calculate quantity of cement,sand &amp; …
There are two main ways to design the concrete mix.Design mix method : In this method,materials are proportioned based on the procedure and rules given in IS 456 (2000) and IS 10262) code.In this method,cement,sand and aggregates are always batched in terms of weight,and concrete can be designed for different environmental conditions and different needs.FOR 1cubic meter of concrete block,firstly we must know the mix ratio but if e.g we have the ratio of 1:2:4,1 is cement 2 is sand 4 is aggregate than we need these quantities for 1 meter cube 0.Eastern Price List17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Advance notice In order to provide the best possible service,we encourage customers to place orders by 3:00 p.m.the day before the concrete is required.Quantity &amp; rate When you are placing an order,we must know the quantity of concrete that will be used on a particular pour,and the required pour rate in cubic metres per hour.Concrete Calculator.Use our concrete calculator to determine the amount of concrete needed to pour your concrete slab.Enter the width and length of your slab in metres.Then enter the thickness of your slab in millimetres.The amount of concrete you require will display in cubic metres in the blue box.

How heavy is concrete? Calculate how many cubic feet ( cu ft ft3 ) of concrete are in 1 cubic meter ( 1 m3 ).Specific unit weight of concrete amount properties converter for conversion factor exchange from 1 cubic meter m3 equals = 35.31 cubic feet cu ft ft3 exactly for the masonry material type.To convert concrete measuring units can be useful when building with concrete and where.15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This series of concrete calculators has been developed to help you plan your project.You can calculate how much concrete,cement,sand,mortar or render you will need.For each calculation you will have to know the dimensions of your object.The calculator will perform the sums for you where relevant it will add a small percentage for the wastage that inevitably happens when mixing &amp; using.Mixing Concrete by hand,cement mixer or using …Mixing Concrete.When it comes to mixing concrete,there are three options to choose from: Mix by hand where less than &#188;m&#179; of concrete is needed,it can be mixed by hand by a reasonably fit person.; Use a cement mixer where the quantity is between about &#188;m&#179; and 2m&#179;,a powered concrete mixer is useful or ; Buying in Ready Mix where more than 2m&#179; of concrete is needed,it is easier.Hi,We use minimum grade of concrete for RCC = M20.For M20,GRADE = 1:1.5:3 Volume of Concrete = L x B x D= 1 cum.Wet Volume of concrete = 1 cum Dry volume of concrete = 1.52 x 1 = 1.52 cum.Ratio = 1:1.5:3 = 5.5 * Cement = 1.52[ 1 (1+1.5+3)].
