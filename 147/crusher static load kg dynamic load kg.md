## What's the difference between dynamic load capacity …
Static load capacity,C 0,is the amount of load a bearing can withstand before the sum of the ball and raceway deformation equals 0.01 percent of (0.0001 times) the ball diameter,as defined by ISO 14728 2.Static load capacity is almost always higher than dynamic load capacity because its limitation is plastic deformation of the ball and raceway material,which occurs when the load is applied.When is static load capacity important?When is static load capacity important?.which is based on dynamic load capacity.This is the load at which a linear recirculating bearing will,with 90 percent certainty,achieve the targeted service life before fatigue occurs.Static load capacity,on the other hand,is the force that causes permanent deformation of the rolling element.
