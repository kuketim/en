## Processes for Beneficiation of Iron Ores IspatGuru
Processes for Beneficiation of Iron Ores.Washing is the simplest iron ore concentration process that takes advantage of the high specific gravity and comparatively coarse size of the iron bearing minerals to separate them from the finer,lighter,siliceous gangue which is predominantly quartz and clay minerals.Iron Ore Introduction: Ore,which contains an economical use of iron,is called an iron ore.There are many types of iron ore,magnetite (Fe3O4),hematite (Fe2O3) and (FeCO3),etc,which are mainly used for iron making.Iron ore is an important raw material for iron and steel production enterprises.Iron Ore Processing Plant31&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Iron is found in the world's oldest and most widely used,is the largest amount metal,the metal consumption of about 95% of total consumption.Iron ore is mainly used for iron and steel industry,smelting iron and steel according tothe different carbon content.The so called iron ore deposits is the main target of industrial development and utilization.Iron ore beneficiation plant is generally.The process adopted to upgrade the Fe content of iron ore is known as iron ore beneficiation (IOB).However,Iron ores from different sources have their own peculiar mineralogical characteristics and require the specific beneficiation and metallurgical treatment to get the best product out of it.

28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Iron Ore Beneficiation Technology.Almost all of the iron ores are used in steelmaking.Iron ore is mined in about 50 countries.Australia and Brazil together dominate the world's largest iron ore exports,each having about one third of the total exports.The banded iron formations are found throughout the world and are the most important iron.12&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;However,for other iron ore types,full liberation of the iron minerals may not be required.Direct Shipping Ores,as the name suggests,require no beneficiation,although frequently wet screening is required,(particularly for tropical deposits),to minimise adhesion of fines to a potential Lump product.Iron Ore Geoscience Australia5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Pure mineral hematite contains 69.9% iron.It has been the dominant iron ore mined in Australia since the early 1960s and approximately 96% of Australia's iron ore exports are high grade hematite,most of which has been mined from deposits in the Hamersley province in Western Australia.The Iron Ore Mining industry has benefited from rising prices and higher production volumes over the past five years.As a result,industry revenue is expected to increase at an annualised 1.1% over the five years through 20,to $81.2 billion.
