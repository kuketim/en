## What Is Lime Used for in Water Treatment? Sciencing
Lime is a manufactured product made from limestone (calcium carbonate) or dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate).The raw material is processed into quicklime and hydrated lime.Since it is alkaline,it's often used to adjust the pH of water and soils containingTop 10 Liming QuestionsHow long does it take for lime to work? Since water is required for lime to react with the soil,effects of a lime application will be slower in a dry soil.It often takes a year or more before a response can be measured even under perfect conditions.However,a response.
