## Bauxite
Raw bauxite ores sourced from India,Guinea,Ghana,and United States were characterized and compared in terms elemental and mineral composition,fluoride adsorption affinity and capacity,surface area,and equilibrium suspension pH [24].Fig.12.4 shows images of each bauxite ore as received (before milling),after milling,and with scanning electron microscopy (SEM).BauxiteGuinea has the world’s largest reserves of bauxite,the ore used to produce aluminum.Containing a content of alumina,Guinean bauxite reserves are estimated at over 40 billion tons,23 billion tons of which are located in the Bok&#233; region.Guinea has the world’s.

## What is the ore of bauxite?
Bauxite is the principal aluminum ore consisting of a mixture of minerals,namely gibbsite (Al(OH)3),boehmite (γ AlO(OH)) and diaspore (α AlO(OH)),and the iron oxides goethite and hematite.It can also contain smaller amounts of the clay mineral.Extraction Process of Aluminium from Bauxite OreAlumina Extraction Problem In the standard Bayer Process for refining bauxite to produce alumina,the dissolution of the alumina in the ore to form sodium aluminate is accomplished in autoclaves under high pressures varying from 70 to 200 pounds per square inch.
