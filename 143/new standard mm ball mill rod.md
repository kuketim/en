## Rod Mill
Rod mills have an industrial yield that is less than that of a ball mill,which explains the fact that balls have a much larger grinding surface than rods.The power needed to operate a rod mill could exceed 30% of the power used in a ball mill.When they are worn,rods must not stretch but break in rather small pieces,soGrinding control strategy on the conventional milling.27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;milling circuit consists of a rod mill followed by a ball mill in series.Crusher product ( mm) is fed to the rod mill,and the water is fed in ratio to the ore feed mass.The rod mill discharge is pumped,without any further water addition,to the first ball mill.The ball mill discharges to a sump where water is
