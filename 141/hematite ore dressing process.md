## ore dressing processes
Four Kinds of Hematite Ore Dressing Processes.The inhibitor of iron ore uses the sodium silicate,tannin and sodium lignosulfonate,and their inhibitory effect is the best when the pH value is 8 9.In terms of the ore properties of hematite ore,reverse flotation process is more advantageous than the positive flotation process.
