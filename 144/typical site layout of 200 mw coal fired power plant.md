## What is the average output MW of a coal power plant …
There are 492 coal fired power plants in the U.S.with an average size of 667 megawatts (MW) and an average age of 40 years.Source: &quot;Form EIA Database,Annual Electric Generator Report,&quot; U.S.Basic Layout and Working of a Thermal Power Plant.26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Coal: In a coal based thermal power plant,coal is transported from coal mines to the generating station.Generally,bituminous coal or brown coal is used as fuel.The coal is stored in either 'dead storage' or in 'live storage'.Dead storage is generally 40 days backup coal storage which is used when coal supply is unavailable.
