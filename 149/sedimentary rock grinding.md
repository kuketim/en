## List of Top 15 Sedimentary Rocks Geology
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Sedimentary Rock # 1.Arkose: This is a sedimentary rock with a high feldspar content (usually orthoclase or microcline),derived from weathering of feldspar rich rocks like granites and gneisses.It contains some rock fragments and micas in a fine grained matrix.Red colouration is caused by the presence of hematite and iron staining.Sedimentary Mineral Deposits2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mechanical Deposition of Sedimentary Mineral Deposits.In some cases,the ore mineral,on account of its resistance to weathering and its hardness,survived the destruction of many of the rock minerals; and,during sedimentation,on account of its weight,it was sorted out from the fragments of quartz and other resistant minerals.

Breccia; Breccia is a clastic sedimentary rock that shaped from angular and boulder size clasts cemented or in a matrix.The angular shaped of clast show that they have not been transported from their source.There are numerous modes of formation for breccia.sedimentary rocks of dolomite,south africa ball mill.Dolomite,also known as &quot;dolostone&quot; and &quot;dolomite rock,&quot; is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of the mineral dolomite,CaMg(CO 3) 2.Dolomite is found in sedimentary basins worldwide.It is thought to form by the postdepositional alteration of lime mud and limestone by magnesium rich groundwater.

## sedimentary rock
30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Sedimentary rocks are the lithified equivalents of sediments.They typically are produced by cementing,compacting,and otherwise solidifying preexisting unconsolidated sediments.Some varieties of sedimentary rock,however,are precipitated directly into their solid sedimentary form and exhibit no intervening existence as sediment.Classifications of Rocks: Sedimentary,Igneous and.Granite is intrusive igneous rock.Grinding stones used to prepare paste powder of spices and grains are made of granite.Extrusive Igneous Rocks: When the molten magma (lava) comes on the earth’s surface.It rapidly cools down and becomes solid.Rocks formed in such a manner on the crust are called extrusive igneous rocks.

## Sedimentary Rocks
Some examples of sedimentary rocks are limestone,sandstone,siltstone,shale,conglomerate,and breccia.Most sedimentary rocks contain either quartz or calcite.In contrast with igneous and metamorphic rocks,a sedimentary rock usually contains very few different major minerals,and it has lower strengths and higher porosity.Are sedimentary rocks rough or smooth?Any igneous rock,if ground down to a smooth face and polished,will be smooth.Any igneous rock,if cut,will display a jagged edge.There is the potential for any igneous rock to be smooth or rough.

The heat and pressure comes from inside the earth.From the upper mantle up to within a few kilometers of the surface of the earth there is a …Exercises on Sedimentary Rocks Introductory …The most prevalent type of mechanical weathering is the collision,breaking,and grinding of rock by the movement of a fluid,either water or air.The size of the carried sediment depends on the type of fluid and speed of the movement.A fast fluid (e.g.a rapidly flowing river) can carry large particles and cause immense amounts of weathering.

## What Makes Metamorphic Rocks So Unique?
The sedimentary rock shale metamorphoses first into slate,then into phyllite,then a mica rich schist.The mineral quartz does not change under high temperature and pressure,although it becomes more strongly cemented.Thus,the sedimentary rock sandstone turns to quartzite.Everything You Need to Know About SandstoneSandstone is a type of rock made from sediment — a sedimentary rock.The sediment particles are clasts,or pieces,of minerals and fragments of rock,thus sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock.It is composed mostly of sand particles,which are of medium size; therefore,sandstone is a medium grained clastic sedimentary rock.More precisely.
