## Vertical Machining Centers (VMCs) : Modern Machine Shop
CNC vertical machining centers (VMCs) remain machine shop staples.These milling machines have vertically oriented spindles that approach workpieces mounted on their table from above and commonly perform 2.5 or 3 axis machining operations.They are less costly than horizontal machining centers.Milling Process,Defects,EquipmentFor vertical milling machines,the cutters take a very different form.The cutter teeth cover only a portion of the tool,while the remaining length is a smooth surface,called the shank.The shank is the section of the cutter that is secured inside the collet,for attachment to the spindle.
