The aim of the research is a comprehensive evaluation of concrete using the EIPI method.In the evaluation the compressive strength of concrete and its durability properties represented by sorptivity and air permeability are taken into account.Since waste copper slag with increased natural radioactivity is used in the assessed concrete,additional evaluation is carried out taking into account.Disposal and Reuse Options for Used Sandblasting GritSandblasting is used to clean dirt,corrosion,paint or other coatings from a variety of surfaces.The clean grit should in most cases contain no hazardous properties.Common industries where sandblasting is applied include shipbuilding and maintenance.
