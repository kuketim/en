## Artisanal and Small Scale Gold Mining Without …
Although many miners use mercury in artisanal and small scale gold mining,it is possible to safely and economically recover gold without it.Mercury free techniques are safer for miners,their families and local communities.They may also help miners market their gold at higher prices.2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Of all the methods of extracting gold &amp; processing it from its ore,I used a few to evaluate two principal flowsheets in this case study.The flowsheets utilized operations that involved flotation,cyanidation and gravity concentration.Tests that mirror each of these unit operations were utilized to evaluate the principal flowsheets.This page offers a comparative review of gold recovery.Gold Refining SystemsFor the first time ever,gold processing can be done with a high level of confidence and safety,from a very small jewelry business to medium scale refinery.The process is simple and easy.By using our REFINEIT system,all the user has to do is melt the gold in an ingot,submerge the gold in the gold refining equipment we provide,then wait.Another set of screens filters out the carbon grains,which can be recycled for future processing.Finally,the gold bearing solution is ready for electrowinning,which recovers the gold from the leaching chemicals.In electrowinning,operators pour the gold bearing solution into a …
