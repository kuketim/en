## What is the difference between a rock and a mineral?
6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A mineral is a naturally occurring inorganic element or compound having an orderly internal structure and characteristic chemical composition,crystal form,and physical properties.Common minerals include quartz,feldspar,mica,amphibole,olivine,and calcite.A rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals,or a body of undifferentiated mineral matter.YupRocks.comThe crystal structure of the Graphite mineral is that of a two dimensional planar,but that of diamond,is a three dimensional one.As regards the properties of Graphite,it is a very good conductor of electricity and heat,and when compared to other materials,its stiffness and strength are of the highest order.

## Graphite: The mineral Graphite information and pictures
Graphite is a mineral composed exclusively of the element carbon.Graphite has the same chemical composition as Diamond,which is also pure carbon,but the molecular structure of Graphite and Diamond is entirely different.This causes almost opposite characteristics in their physical properties.OVERVIEW Global Li Ion GraphiteWhat is graphite? Graphite is a crystalline form of pure carbon which occurs naturally in the earths crust.When carbon rich sediments are buried under kilometers of rock over time the heat and pressure,causes the carbon atoms to arrange into a crystal form we call the mineral graphite (under extreme pressures and temperatures under hundreds of kilometers of rock,carbon atoms take the form.
