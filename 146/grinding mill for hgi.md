## Investigation into the applicability of Bond Work Index.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI) test is based on Rittinger’s theory that “the work done in grinding is proportional to the new surface produced”.The index varies from 20 to 110,with a lower HGI indicating a coal is harder to grind ancoal mill hardgrove power consumptionUNIT 1 HARDGROVE GRINDABILITY INDEX acarp It should be noted that coals with lower HGI's need more power to drive the pulverizer than.capacity the mill produces coal with a higher proportion less than 75 microns and above rated.
