## Iron ore
Iron ore mining methods vary by the type of ore being mined.There are four main types of iron ore deposits worked currently,depending on the mineralogy and geology of the ore deposits.These are magnetite,titanomagnetite,massive hematite and pisoliticMining of Iron Ores IspatGuruIron ore is almost exclusively mined by surface operations.The most predominant surface mining methods used for mining of iron ores are open pit mining methods and open cut mining methods.However a few underground iron ore mines are also in operation around the globe.The decision for employing surface mining or underground mining is.
