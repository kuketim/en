## Effect of the Mineralogical Composition of Limestone …
31&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Limestone has been used as a partial substitute for cement,due to its beneficial effect on mechanical properties of mortars and concretes.In the present research,we studied the effect of the mineralogical composition in mortars produced from limestone samples collected in different areas of Mozambique,using two cement types (Portland cement 32.5N and 42.5N).The Benefits and Effects of Limestone SciencingAs a sedimentary rock,limestone consists of the mineral calcite,shellfish fossils and other shallow sea creatures,clay,chert,silt and dolomite.Limestone’s uses are many,based on the desired effect it creates.Manufacturers use limestone for making glass.They also use it in building materials such as travertine and other decorative tiles.

## Effect of Limestone and Wooden Dust as a Filler Material.
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The quality of the limestone filler affects the performance of the cement in concrete and the water demand of the cement.Most of the limestone dust can be used as an additive in concrete mixes to improve the strength at early stage.Limestone is naturally available,cheap and it …Modeling the influence of limestone filler on cement.Abstract The ASTM C150 standard specification for Portland cement now permits the cement to contain up to 5% of ground limestone.While these and much higher levels of limestone filler substitution have been employed in Europe and elsewhere for many years,changing the ASTM standard has been a slow process.Having computational tools to assist in better understanding the influence of limestone.
