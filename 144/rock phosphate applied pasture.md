## Trials: Reactive Phosphate Rock
Trial aim To evaluate the effectiveness of reactive phosphate rock (RPR) as a phosphorus fertiliser for pastures in Australia,trials were completed across the major pasture production areas of Australia.The results of these trials were subsequently published in a book titled The Role of Reactive Rock Phosphate Fertilisers for Pastures in Australia.Availability of Rock Phosphate as Measured by an …Where superphosphate or rock phosphate had been applied,P availability was better assessed by extractants such as 0.5 M NaHCO 3 and Bray 1.The results emphasize the need to supplement laboratory and short‐term studies with long‐term evaluations of P materials with acid tolerant perennial crop species available in tropical countries.
