## Steelmaking
Steelmaking is the process of producing steel from iron ore and or scrap.In steelmaking,impurities such as nitrogen,silicon,phosphorus,sulfur and excess carbon (most important impurity) are removed from the sourced iron,and alloying elements such as manganese,nickel,chromium,carbon and vanadium are added to producIron Ore Sintering Process Model to Study Local.The iron ore sintering process prepares fine iron the ores for the blast furnace process.Sinter plants agglomerate iron ore fines with other fine materials at high temperature in a mix bed to create a product that can be used in a blast furnace.Main feed into a sinter plant is bas
