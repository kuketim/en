## molybdenum flotation concentrate
A Molybdenum Flotation case study with about 6% of the molybdenum contained in the feed is present as an oxide form and about 90% of this is not recovered to the flotation concentrate.Recovery of molybdenum into the rougher concentrate varied between 90 to 95% at a concentrate grade of 2.5 to 3.7% molybdenum.Molybdenum Ore ConcentrateMolybdenum produced as a by product of copper from copper porphyry deposits,like the Bingham Canyon deposit in Utah,is removed as molybdenum disulfate during flotation of the powder copper …
