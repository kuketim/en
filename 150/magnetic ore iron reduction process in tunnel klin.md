## Direct reduced iron
Direct reduced iron (DRI),also called sponge iron,[1] is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps,pellets,or fines) to iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction.Direct reduction refers to solid state processes which reduce iron.Technology Tata Steel Long Products LimitedSteel production through the conventional blast furnace route requires coking coal in abundance,which is a limited resource in our country and is also becoming scarce world over.Hence,a new technology TISCO Direct Reduction (TDR) technology was evolved that helped in the reduction of iron ore by using abundantly available non coking coal.
