## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.Rock Crushing Rule of ThumbThe approximate capacity of a jaw crusher for hard rock application at a typical setting may be obtained by multiplying the width by 10 to get tonnes per hour.For example,a 48 by 60 crusher will have a capacity in the order of 600 tph when crushing ore in a hard rock mine.
