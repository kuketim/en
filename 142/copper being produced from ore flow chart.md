## Copper Smelting Process
Modern copper smelters use processed copper ore fed into a flash furnace,typically fired by oxygen which produces blister copper,being further processed in a converter furnace.Molten copper is poured from here into rectangular moulds,the resulting ingots subjected to electrolysis producing a metal of 99.9% purity.Copper can be recycled indefinitely without the base metal being compromised.Extracting iron and copper&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;in the Earth's crust.An ore is a rock that contains enough of a metal or a metal compound to make extracting the metal.Molten copper can be produced from copper …

## How copper is made
In South America,copper objects were being produced along the northern coast of Peru as early as 500 B.C.and the development of copper metallurgy was well advanced by the time the Inca empire fell to the conquering Spanish soldiers in the 1500s.The BalanceIronmaking,the first step in making steel,involves the raw inputs of iron ore,coke,and lime being melted in a blast furnace.Secondary steelmaking involves treating the molten steel produced from both BOS and EAF routes to adjust the steel composition.

## How aluminium is produced
The aluminium production process can be broken down into three stages; first bauxites,which contain aluminium,are extracted from the ground.Second,bauxites are processed into alumina or aluminium oxide,and finally in stage three,pure aluminium is produced.Copper Production: How Is Copper Made?Copper processing is a complex process that involves many steps as the manufacturer processes the ore from its raw,mined state into a purified form for use in many industries.Copper is typically extracted from oxide and sulfide ores that contain between 0.5 and 2.0% copper.
