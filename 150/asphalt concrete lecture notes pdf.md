## Difference Between Asphalt &amp; Concrete
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Daren.R Young,founder &amp; CEO of DRYCO Construction,Inc.explains the difference between asphalt and concrete in terms of pavement maintenance.This clip was taken from the DRYCO Pavement.Construction MaterialsMaterials most frequently used include steel,aggregate,concrete,masonry,asphalt,and wood.Materials used to a lesser extent include aluminium,glass,plastics,and fibre reinforced composites.Geotechnical engineers make a reasonable case for including soil as the most widely used engineering material,since it provides the basic support for all civil engineering structures.
