Ore Monocular Microscope is a principal piece of polarising microscope fitted with reflected &amp; transmitted light illuminators used by Geologists to observe the optical properties of minerals.It has indispensable applications for Petrography,Crystallography,Geology or finding stress points in metal,glass textiles,etc.Under a microscope,various constituents,such as organic macerals of combustible matter and inorganic minerals of ashy matter,can be seen.The petrological texture of coal indicates the possibility of liberation of different constituents by crushing and grinding.The first step of washing is to crush or grind the coal to liberate the coaly.Iron ore5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Increasing iron ore demand,coupled with the depletion of high grade hematite ores in the United States,after World War II led to development of lower grade iron ore sources,principally the utilization of magnetite and taconite.Iron ore mining methods vary by the type of ore being mined.26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;ORE MINERALS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE By JAMES A.NOBLE THE student of geology in the course of his train&#173; ing usually passes through three stages of achieve&#173; ment: A first in which he learns to identify the
