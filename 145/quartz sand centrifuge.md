## Correlation between the Shear Wave Velocity and Tip ‚Ä¶
In centrifuge modeling,it is important to evaluate the in flight strength and stiffness parameters of the soil model to understand soil behavior.Both the shear wave velocity (V s) and cone tip resistance (q c) are commonly used to determine the stiffness and strength characteristics of soils.Chromite sand separationChromite sand is sometimes used as facing sand,whereby quartz sand is used as filler sand but also as a mold material for core production.Consequently,in addition to quartz sand and binder residues,the accumulating used sand also contains valuable chromite sand which is to be reclaimed during used sand conditioning.

However,only a small fraction has sufficient purity (&gt; 99.98 %) to be suitable as raw material for quartz glass.Sand at the beach is also SiO 2,but isn‚Äôt suitable for use in the semiconductor industry.Structure of quartz and fused silica In the quartz glass structure all atoms are bonded t at least two others.Quartz sandQuartz sand conditioning in the mines extends to washing and purification processes followed by hydraulic classification,flotation,if necessary,and drying in rotary and fluidized bed aggregates.The suitability of quartz grains as molding material is mainly determined by the SiO2 content.
