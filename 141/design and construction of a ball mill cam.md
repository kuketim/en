## Ball Mill: Operating principles,components,Uses
A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis.The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 50% of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.MillsOur simple modular design has been perfected over 40 years.This design minimizes the amount of potential problems and simplifies maintenance and repair.Properly maintained,a Digital Dental Mill is designed to last for 15+ years in a 24 7 production environment.
