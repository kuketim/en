Grate coolers To cool cement clinker,kiln lines are equipped with a “pendulum” grate cooler with a “KIDS” stationary inlet and grate with a hydraulic drive The cooled clinker is then crushed by means of a roller crusher installed at the end of the grate areaCement grinding coolerThe heated air from the coolers is returned to the kilns,a process that saves fuel and increases burning efficiency.After the clinker is cooled,cement plants grind it and mix it with small amounts of gypsum and limestone.Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains.

## Multi objective optimization of cooling air distribution.
The paper discussed a multi objective optimization model of the cooling air distribution of a grate cooler according to the analogy of a cross flow heat exchanger and entropy generation minimization analysis.The modified entropy generation numbers caused by heat transfer and flowing resistance are regarded as objective functions,and are simultaneously optimized by a genetic algorithm.Grate Cooler For Cement Plant stauffenbergkreiseuControl Flow Grate Cooler,clinker grate cooler,Grate cooler mechanical in cement plant Grate cooler is a major mainframe equipment of cement clinker burning system The cooler mechanical main function is cooling and transporting the cement clinker and providing rotary kiln and decompressing furnace with hot gas
