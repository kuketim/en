## Copper Mining and Extraction Sulfide Ores
This KS3 education resource looks at copper mining,extraction and pyroprocessing of sulfide ores.Processing Stages Stage 1: Crushing and grinding The ore from the mine contains about 2% copper.To get at the copper the first stage is crushing in hugeConstruction of isotherms in solvent extraction of …The aim of this work is construction of equilibrium isotherms in solvent extraction.Technological parameters have been predicted for treatment of mine water by solvent extraction and electrowining.Two stages of extractions and one stage of stripping have been predicted for copper recovery by analyzing the equilibrium isotherms.

## Copper
7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu (from Latin: cuprum) and atomic number 29.It is a soft,malleable,and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity.A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish orange color.Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity,as a building material,and as a constituent of various metal alloys,such as sterling.Copper extraction by fatty hydroxamic acids …The results showed that the fatty hydroxamic acid derivatives could extract copper at pH 6.2 effectively with high percentage of extraction (the percentages of copper extraction by MFHAs,PFHAs,IPFHs and BFHAs were found to be 99.3,87.5,82.3 and 90.2%,respectively).
