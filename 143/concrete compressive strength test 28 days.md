## Acceptance testing and criteria for ready mixed concrete in Hong …
18 General Specification for Civil Engineering Works: 2006 • Acceptance testing and criteria given in Clauses 16.58 to 16.62 • Clause 16.59 • 2 cubes shall be made in accordance to CS1 • Test result = average compressive strength of each pair of cubes made fromThe 28 Day MythIt is estimated that concrete reaches 75% of this 28 day compressive strength in seven days,and its strength will remain stable or even increase over time (2).A specific ratio can be determined for each specific mix design and curing process to fine tune this arbitrary age so that the mix design dictates the 28 day compressive strength.
