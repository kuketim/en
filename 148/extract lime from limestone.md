## How Lime is Made The National Lime Association
In the Beginning.Limestone is a naturally occurring and abundant sedimentary rock consisting of high levels of calcium and or magnesium carbonate and or dolomite (calcium and magnesium carbonate),along with minerals.Lime production begins by extracting limestone from quarries and mines.GCSE CHEMISTRY Extraction of Iron in the Blast Furnace.to the blast furnace to remove the impurities in the iron ore.Calcium carbonate is decomposed by heat in the furnace to give calcium oxide (quicklime) and carbon dioxide.This is called thermal decomposition (see examples of other carbonates).calcium carbonate calcium oxide + carbon dioxide.CaCO3(s) CaO(s) + CO2(g).
