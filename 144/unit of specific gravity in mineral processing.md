Definition from WhatIsSpecific gravity is a dimensionless quantity; that is,it is not expressed in units To find the sp gr of a solid or liquid,you must know its density in kilograms per meter cubed (kg m 3 ) or in grams per centimeter cubed (g cm 3 )

## SPECIFIC GRAVITY? Amethyst Galleries' Mineral Gallery
Specific gravity is a unitless measure,because it is derived from the density of the mineral divided by the density of water and thus all units cancel However,since water's density equals 1 gram per cubic centimeter (at specific conditions),then a mineral's specific gravity would also correspond to a mineral's density as expressed in grams.Mineral processing5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mineral processing,otherwise known as mineral dressing,is the practice of beneficiating valuable minerals from their ores.Industrial mineral treatment processes usually combine a number of unit operations in order to liberate and separate minerals by exploiting the differences in physical properties of the different minerals that make up an ore.

API Gravity.Density is defined as mass per unit volume of a fluid.The density of crude oil and liquid hydrocarbons is usually reported in terms of specific gravity (SG) or relative density,defined as the density of the liquid material at 60&#176;F (15.6&#176;C) divided by the density of liquid water at 60&#176;F.Mineral Sands Technical Information Iluka,Mineral Sands Technical Information Mineral Sands,with a specific gravity greater than 285 t m³ Mineral sands deposits are characterised by their grade (the percentage of HM found in a deposit) and their assemblage (the,order processing of mineral sands and process derivativ
