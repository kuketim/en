What is Reflection of Light? Light rays travel in a straight line.A ray is a very narrow beam of light.An object can only be seen when light rays from the object enter our eyes.These light rays can come directly from the object or as a result of the object reflectingMirrorThe first mirrors used by humans were most likely pools of dark,still water,or water collected in a primitive vessel of some sort.The requirements for making a good mirror are a surface with a very high degree of flatness (preferably but not necessarily with high reflectivity),and a surface roughness smaller than the wavelength of the light.
