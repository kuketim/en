However,in pure energy efficiency terms,the benefit of grinding power reduction is countered by the very high power required by mill fans.In addition,the absence of the heat generated in a ball mill and the high volume of air required by the vertical mill have required the provision of waste heat from cooler exhausts and or auxiliary furnaces to dry raw macalculation of specific power consumption of ball mill …The power drawn by the main motor of a ball mill proportional to the weight of the grinding media in the mill.We are achieving specific heat consumption of 1300 kcals kg clinker.Q: How do i calculate circulation factor in roller press.

## Best energy consumption
However,in pure energy efficiency terms,the benefit of grinding power reduction is countered by the very high power required by mill fans.In addition,the absence of the heat generated in a ball mill and the high volume of air required by the vertical mill have required the provision of waste heat from cooler exhausts and or auxiliary furnaces to dry raw materials and achieve a limited.Ball Charge and Grinding EfficiencyThe volume of grinding media in a mill is directly related to grinding efficiency.The higher the volume of grinding media the more effective the grind.Balls must be added to maintain the media load and mill power draw.The power draw increases as balls are added and decreases as media wears down: add balls.
