## Rock Strength
Strain rate greatly affected the relation between compressive rock strength and temperature according to the experiments [21].From Fig.5.2,the following conclusions can be made.(1) At a certain temperature the compressive strength of Dresser basalt is greater under a higher strain rate than that under a lower one.How to Determine Break Strength of Tile HunkerEvaluate the break strength rating in comparison with industry requirements.The break strength of a tile is the amount of weight that it can withstand unsupported before it breaks.The ANSI requires a break strength of at least 250 lbs.for floor tiles.If you're looking at a break strength lower than that,you can't use that tile on the floor.
