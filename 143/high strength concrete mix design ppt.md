High strength concrete.High strength concrete (HSC) may be defined as concrete with a specified characteristic cube strength between 60 and 100 N mm 2,although higher strengths have been achieved and used.Strength levels of 80 to 100 N mm 2 and even higher are being used for both precast and in situ work in the USA,France,Norway and some other countries.COARSE AGGREGATES IN HIGH STRENGTH CONCRETEIn the case of high strength concrete,the effect of a weakened paste to aggregate bond can be extremely detrimental to strength.For this reason,use of clean,washed aggregate in the production of high strength concrete is highly suggested.

While a concrete mix design is a process of selecting ingredients for a concrete mixture and deciding on their proportions.When designing a mix,you should always consider the desired strength,durability,and workability of the concrete for the project in question.High strength concreteHigh Value Concrete High Early Strength Concrete • High early strength cement • High cement content 400 to 600 kg m3 • Low water cementing materials ratio (0.20 to 0.45 by mass) • Higher freshly mixed concrete temperature • Higher curing temperature May be 18.
