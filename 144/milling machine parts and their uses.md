## Milling (machining)
Milling is a cutting process that uses a milling cutter to remove material from the surface of a work piece.The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool,often with multiple cutting points.As opposed to drilling,where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis,the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter.Horizontal Milling,Vertical MillingA milling machine is basically used for shaping,routing,boring,and drilling metals and other solid materials.Generally there are two categories of the milling machine which include the vertical type and the horizontal type.In order to optimize the capacity of the milling machine,it is essential to identify the appropriate milling machine type for specific tasks.Today,there are a number.
