## Grinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process Control
Grinding in ball mills is an important technological process applied to reduce the size of particles which may have different nature and a wide diversity of physical,mechanical and chemical characteristics.Typical examples are the various ores,minerals,limestone,etc.The applications of ball mills are ubiquitous in mineralSino Grinding Mineral ProcessingMineral processing typically involves the crushing and grinding of hard rock ore.Crushed ore is introduced to semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mills,also known as primary mills,where grinding media is released like hammers to assist in the ore cracking grinding process.
