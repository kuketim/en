Volcanic ash particles erupted during magmatic eruptions are made up of various fractions of vitric (glassy,non crystalline),crystalline or lithic (non magmatic) particles.Ash produced during low viscosity magmatic eruptions (e.g.Hawaiian and Strombolian basaltic eruptions) produce a range of different pyroclasts dependent on the eruptive process.S.Tsivilis's research works National Technical.S.Tsivilis's 77 research works with 3,594 citations and 20,476 reads,including: Synthesis and Characterization of Porous Fly Ash Based Geopolymers Using Si as Foaming Agent
