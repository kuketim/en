## Aggregate Crushing Value Test
The aggregate crushing value is a numerical index of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load.It is expressed as the percentage by mass of the crushed (or finer) material obtained when the test sample is subjected to a specified load under standard conditions.Existing Surface Preparation for OverlaysOverlays (either structural or non structural) make up a large portion of the roadway paving done today.The degree of surface preparation for an overlay is dependent on the condition and type of the existing pavement.Generally,the existing pavement should be.
