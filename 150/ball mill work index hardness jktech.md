## Bond Ball Mill Index Test JKTech
A Bond Ball Mill Work Index may also be used in the simulation and optimisation of existing mill(s) and the associated grinding circuit(s).Sample Requirements: A minimum of 8 kg of material crushed to nominally minus 10 mm is preferred.JKTech would stage crush the sample to minus 3.35 mm,as requirTechnical InformationOnly relatively small quantities of sample are required and can be re used to conduct Bond ball work index tests.The results from conducting the SMC Test&#174; are used to determine the so called drop weight index (DWi) which is a measure
