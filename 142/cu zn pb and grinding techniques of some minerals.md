Typical ore compositions are 0.8% Cu,1.6% Pb,11.0% Zn,17.0% Fe and 6.5 g t Ag.During a series of tests aimed at improving Cu Zn separation significant collectorless flotation was observed.A collectorless float yielded recoveries of about 90% Cu,60% PbCANATUAN CU ZN FLOTATION METALLURGYlow Zn ores to low Cu high Zn ores.Due to this mineralogical stratification,emphasis on the high Cu low Zn ores was set for the initial 2 years of operation.This provided some time to gather enough plant data to study the metallurgical properties of Cu and
