## Reduction of phosphorus and alkali levels in coking coals.
Abstract.A number of coals,though exhibiting desirable coking properties,can have undesirable levels of alkalis and phosphorus.All the phosphorus in the coal will report to the coke,eventually to the iron and thence to the steel,with adverse effects on its metallurgical properties.Occurrence of phosphorus minerals in Australian coal seams,The phosphorus content of dried modern plants is typically around ten times that of coal (Francis,1961),so that the phosphorus found in coal seams is probably less than that developed in the vegetation of the original peat accumulations
