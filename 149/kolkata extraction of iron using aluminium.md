## How aluminum foil is made
Aluminum foil is inexpensive,durable,non toxic,and greaseproof.In addition,it resists chemical attack and provides excellent electrical and non magnetic shielding.Shipments (in 1991) of aluminum foil totaled 913 million pounds,with packaging representing seventy five percent of the aluminum foil market.Aluminum Scrap Suppliers,Manufacturers,…Aluminium recycling is the process by which scrap aluminium can be reused in products after its initial production.The process involves simply re melting the metal,which is far less expensive and energy intensive than creating new aluminium through the electrolysis of aluminium oxide (Al2O3),which must first be mined from bauxite ore and then refined using the Bayer process.
