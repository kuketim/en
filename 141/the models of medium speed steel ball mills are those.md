## Product Review: Sieg SX4 Mid Size Mill
For those of us who still use the inch system of measurement,the leadscrews on this version of the mill are 8 TPI pitch,or 1 8&quot; (0.125&quot;) per turn of the handwheel.This is a significant improvement,since the leadscrews on many import tools,including most of those from Sieg that I have reviewed,are based on a metric pitch with the dials reading the approximate inch equivalent.PulverizerTypes of coal pulverizers.Coal pulverizers may be classified by speed,as follows: Low Speed; Medium Speed; High Speed; Low speed Ball and tube mills.A ball mill is a pulverizer that consists of a horizontal rotating cylinder,up to three diameters in length,containing a charge of tumbling or cascading steel

## Ball Mills vs Rod Mills
Because of this,the rod mill can effectively reduce 1â€³ feed size to 10 mesh or finer in open circuit.The voids (or interstitial space) within a rod load are approximately half those in a ball mill grinding load.Rods in place weigh approximately 400 pounds per cu.ft.and balls in place approximately 300 pounds per cu.ft.SAGMILLING.COM.:.Mill Critical Speed DeterminationMill Critical Speed Determination.The &quot;Critical Speed&quot; for a grinding mill is defined as the rotational speed where centrifugal forces equal gravitational forces at the mill shell's inside surface.This is the rotat
