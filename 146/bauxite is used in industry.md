## 101.THE START OF THE BAUXITE INDUSTRY
THE START OF THE BAUXITE INDUSTRY.Despite the high profits made by DEMBA during the early 1940s,the workers in the bauxite industry toiled under very harsh working conditions.In 1943,each working day was of 10 hours duration,and each worker had to work six days a week.By 1947 the working week was reduced to 48 hours.Mining and Refining ProcessTwo to three tonnes of bauxite are required to produce one tonne of alumina.90% of the global alumina supply of around 90 million tonnes is used in aluminium production.Alumina refineries tend to be located close to bauxite mines and or ports for efficient transport of raw materials and of the final product.
