## Pyrite Mineral Uses and Properties
Pyrite is composed of iron and sulfur; however,the mineral does not serve as an important source of either of these elements.Iron is typically obtained from oxide ores such as hematite and magnetite.Iron Sulfide (FeS) & Iron Disulfide (FeS2) Iron Pyrite ReadeNaturally mined metal sulphide crystals with a shimmer.Slightly soluble in water.Formulas: a) Iron disulfide= FeS2.b) Iron sulfide (Iron(II) sulfide)= FeS
