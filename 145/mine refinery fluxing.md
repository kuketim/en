Anode slime (product from electrolytic refining of copper hodes),is one of the most important source for precious metals production.At Aurubis anode slimes are treated in a modern Boliden top blown rotary converter (TBRC) process in two routes and fully controlled by XRF.Bindura Nickel Corporation Smelter Operations2006228&ensp&#0183&enspThe closure of Epoch mine in 1998,and Madziwa mine in 2001,and the reduction of toll treatment,have resulted in low feed supply to the Smelter.The quantity of feed material has gone down significantly,from about 150 000 tons of concentrates per year
