## Iron processing Britannica
1 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Iron processing,use of a smelting process to turn the ore into a form from which products can be fashioned.Included in this article also is a discussion of the mining of iron and of its preparation for smelting.Iron (Fe) is a relatively dense metal with a silvery white appearance and distinctive magnetic properties.It constitutes 5 percent by weight of the Earth’s crust,and it is the.How stainless steel is madeStainless steel can also be cut using flame cutting,which involves a flame fired torch using oxygen and propane in conjunction with iron powder.This method is clean and fast.Another cutting method is known as plasma jet cutting,in which an ionized gas column in conjunction with an electric arc through a small orifice makes the cut.
