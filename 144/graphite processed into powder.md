## Obtaining graphene from graphite
2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Currently there is intense research into chemically functionalising the surface of graphene to enable the tuning of its properties for a particular application.Furthermore as graphene sheets are not soluble in most solvents,improving its solubility via functionalization will enable graphene based materials to be more easily processed for real.Materials ProcessedMaterials processed for powdered carbon,ceramics,minerals,abrasives,chemicals,plastics and test dust.8737.Carbon and graphite material applications are becoming more diverse with particle size typically a primary consideration for optimum application or product performance.Powder Technology Inc.is the leading.
