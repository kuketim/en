## Ball Mill
3.5.2.2 Ball Mills.The ball mill accepts the SAG or AG mill product.Ball mills give a controlled final grind and produce flotation feed of a uniform size.Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore.The balls are initially 5 10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grindiThe Effect of Aspect Ratio on the Grinding Efficiency …The most recent published contribution on the topic of SAG mill aspect ratio dates to Morrell (2007) with his paper &quot;The effect of aspect ratio on the grinding efficiency of open and closed.

## GRINDING MILLS SAG MILLS New &amp; Used Mining &amp; Mineral.
SAG mills are essentially autogenous mills,but utilize grinding balls in addition to large rocks to aid in grinding.A SAG mill is generally used as a primary or first stage grinding solution.SAG miAutogenous and Semi Autogenous Millsintermediate size ready for final grinding in a ball mill,pebble mill,or VERTIMILLTM.Wet grinding is accomplished in a slurry of 50 to 80 percent solids.AG SAG mills can accomplish the same size reduction work as two or three stages of crushing and screening,a rod mill,and some or all of the work of a ball mill.

## Choosing a SAG Mill to Achieve Design Performance
A further explanation is required to explain the importance of designing the SAG mill chamber to draw required power at optimum operating conditions of 75% critical speed and less than 30% by volume load.Recent studies in the three foot diameter SAG mill are instructive.The following graph shows the relevant facts as Figure 2.Ring geared mill drivesMill load sharing Maintains equal torques on dual pinion mills throughout the whole speed range.Controlled rollback Prevents backlash and reduces downtime.Mill power ride through Keeps the mill operating even under voltage dips.Over duty cycle Avoids unexpected downtime if the mill …
