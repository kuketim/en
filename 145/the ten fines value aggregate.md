## BS 111:1990
This British Standard,a Part of the BS 812 series,describes methods for the determination of the ten per cent fines value (TFV) of aggregates which give a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load.In.fines 10% test Encyclopediafines 10% test A test that is similar to the aggregate crushing value (ACV) test A sample of aggregate is subjected to varying loads and the percentage of fines calculated for each load A graph of loading versus percentage fines is used to find the loading required for 10% fin Source for information on fines 10% test: A Dictionary of Earth Sciences dictionary

## Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) and Ten Percent …
Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) and Ten Percent Fines Value (TFV) These tests are a measure of the crushing properties of aggregate and use the same basic equipment.The ACV test requires a standard load of 400 kN to be applied over a period of 10 minutes while the TFV test measures the force required to produce a specified depth of plunger.Aggregate Crushing Value Result ParameterAy 5 2010 aggregate crushing value test provides strength of aggregates for resistance against crushing under loads and is used for roads and pavements if the aggregate crushing value is 30 or higher the result may be anomalous and in such cases the ten.

## Aggregate Test
Some familiar aggregate tests previously used in the UK and Ireland,such as Aggregate Crushing Value,Ten Percent Fines Value,Aggregate Impact Value,and Wet Attrition Value,have been withdrawn from use,and do not now have the status of a national standard.Flakiness Index is now measured using round bar sieves,rather than slotted trays.BS :2019This document gives the test method for determination of ten percent fines value (TFV) of aggregates.This method gives a relative measure of the resistance of the aggregate crushing under the gradually applied compressive load.It covers two sets of procedures: the first procedure is applicable for aggregates tested in dry condition; and
