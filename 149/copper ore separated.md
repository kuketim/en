These produce many millions of tonnes of copper ore per year.The main ores of copper are sulfides and oxides.From their chemical formulas you can calculate the percentage of copper in each mineral.However this is not the same as the percentage of copper in the ore as that also contains unwanted silicates and other minerals,called gangue.What's is the price in dollars for 5% copper ore?The price of the ore depends on two things: (1) the value of the copper it contains,minus (2) the cost of recovering that copper (mostly excavating it from the ground,separating it from the gangue minerals,recovering it as metal,and getting it.
