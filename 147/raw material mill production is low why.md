## Rawmill
A raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into &quot;rawmix&quot; during the manufacture of cement.Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln,which transforms it into clinker,which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement,and has a large effect …Cost analysis of spinning mills show raw materials,power.Cost analysis of spinning mills show raw materials,power important factors &quot;Today,the availability of cotton and synthetic staple fibers is not a problem.In 2013 14 season,for the third time in a row,the main production count

## What Top 4 Factors Impact the Cost of Raw Materials?
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Sourcing the Material.One of the most expensive aspects of obtaining and distributing raw materials is sourcing it.If a mine runs low on the source material,if a harsh winter kills crops or if a forest fire takes down acres of lumber,readily available material is reduced,which in turn causes the price of raw material to go up.Clinker quality depends on raw material composition.The samples are analyzed by the XRF system and appropriate pre mix proportions are calculated to achieve the pre mix quality target.The three raw materials are then fed into the pre blending pile.The pre blended material is then reclaimed and placed into one of three raw material bins prior to the raw mill.
