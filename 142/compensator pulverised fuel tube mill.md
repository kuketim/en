## Advances in pulverised fuel technology: understanding coal.
The pulverising (comminution) process is carried out on an on demand basis by devices called pulverisers (or mills).The key element of the pulverised fuel system is the coal pulveriser (mill).The purpose of the pulverisers is the comminution (size reduction) of incoming coal from a typical top size of between 50 and 75 mm down to 75 microns (μm).BALANCING OF PULVERIZED COAL FLOWS TO BURNERS IN …While pulverized limestone with particle size appropriate for creating C W emulsions can be purchased formore &#187; In this case the major cost elements are the capital and operating costs of the grinding mills,resulting in a total cost of about $11 per ton of pulverized limestone,including the cost of raw material and shipping.

## Pulverized coal fired boiler
A pulverized coal fired boiler is an industrial or utility boiler that generates thermal energy by burning pulverized coal (also known as powdered coal or coal dust since it is as fine as face powder in cosmetic makeup) that is blown into the firebox.The basic idea of a firing system using pulverised fuel is to use the whole volume of the furnace for the combustion of solid fuels.
