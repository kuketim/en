## Phosphate ore mill prospect
The Mill removes material from the phosphate ore that is either too coarse or too fine and then separates the sand from the phosphate,resulting in a phosphate concentrate.The resulting concentrate is the raw material and is used in many phosphate products that are created at the Aurora chemical complex.Outotec HIGmill high intensity grinding millOutotec HIGmill High Intensity Grinding Mill.With global ore grades declining and the demand for commodities continuing to increase,mining companies require new ways to cost effectively liberate minerals and maximize recovery levels.The Outotec&#174; HIGmill&#174; is an advanced and energy efficient fine and ultra fine grinding solution that relies.
