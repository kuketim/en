## Concrete Mix Design: Proportioning
When we teach mix design courses,the most frequent comment we get is,“Just give me a mix design.” To do so would be regarded as improper,foolish even.No one does this because a successful concrete mix design at one plant will not always work atMix Design For M35 Grade Of ConcreteThe mix design for M35 Grade Of Concrete for pile foundations provided here is for reference purpose only.Actual site conditions vary and thus this should be adjusted as per the location and other factors.Grade of Concrete : M35 Characteristic Strength (Fck) : 35

## CONCRETE MIXING RATIOS
When making concrete it's important to use the correct concrete mixing ratios to produce a strong,durable concrete mix.To make concrete there are four basic materials you need: portland cement,sand,aggregate (stone),and water.The ratio of aggregate to sand.Conventional grade C20,C25 and C30 concrete mix ratioThe concrete mix ratio refers to the proportion of the components in the concrete.The concrete mix ratio is usually represented by the quality of various materials per cubic meter of concrete,or amount proportion of various materials.The basic requirements for the design of concrete mix ratio are: 1,meet the strength grade of …
