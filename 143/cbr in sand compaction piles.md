## Compaction
 · General Procedure in Compaction Tests Depending on the size of the compaction mould,a fraction of the soil sample having particle size larger than a specific value,say d0,is discarded For example,in the standard Proctor compaction test,the soil particles coarser than 19 mm are discarded before compacting soil in the standard 101.6 mm.Design of driven piles in sandtan 6 is the coefficient of friction between pile and soil and a is coeflicient that varies in the range 60 120 (Bustamante & Gianeselli,1982).In the API guidelines,the value of K is taken as 0.8 for a partial displacement pile and 1 for full dis placement pile,irrespective of the direction

## Soil Improvement: Methods to Enhance Soft Ground …
In organic soils,dynamic compaction has been used to construct sand or stone columns.Typically,a cycle duty crane is used to drop the weight,which ranges from 10 to 30 tons.The crane is rigged with a boom capable of dropping the weight from heights of 50 to 100 feet with a single line,which maximizes the energy of the weight as it strikes the ground.STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKS 2008Water used to increase the moisture content of fills prior to compaction shall have a sulphate (SO 3) content not exceeding 2,500 mg l when tested in accordance with BS 1377: Part 3,clause,and the chloride ion content shall not exceed 2,500 mg l when For.
