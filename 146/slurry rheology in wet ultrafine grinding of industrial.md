## Rheology of pyrite slurry and its dispersant.
Rheology of slurry significantly influenced the grindability,fine grinding performance and energy consumption of industrial minerals in wet grinding.The solid concentration,particle size,temperature and the dispersant,which affected the rheological characteristics of pyrite slurry and the biooxidation process were investigated in this study.This research aimed at the wet grinding process.industrial ultra fine wet ball mill aelabworld.co.za &#183; ultra fine grinding mill is the crystallization of China and Sweden advanced technology,is to guide the mill the world trend of the products.ultra fine grinding mill is the crystallization of advanced technology,which is leading the world trend of the milling machine.ultrafine milling powderSlurry rheology in wet ultrafine grinding of industrial &#183; &#183; Wet ultrafine grinding has been increasingly used for production of ultrafine powders in various industries.It has been known that slurry rheology significantly influences the grindability of industrial minerals in wet ultrafine grinding.It is therefore used as a grinding aid for the wet ultrafine grinding of limestone.The rheological behaviors of ground limestone slurries vary with grinding from a starting dilatant flow ability to a resulting pseudoplastic one with an evident Casson yield stress in combination with a thixotropic character.
