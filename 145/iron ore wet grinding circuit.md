## 11.23 Taconite Ore Processing
10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Processing of taconite consists of crushing and grinding the ore to liberate iron bearing particles,concentrating the ore by separating the particles from the waste material (gangue),and pelletizing the iron ore concentrate.A simplified flow diagram of these processing steps is shown in Figure 11.1.Liberation is the first step in.grinding in iron ore flow process agility teamworkchIron Ore,Production Process of Iron Ore,Iron Ore,After crushing,grinding,magnetic separation,gravity concentration etc,gradually we can get iron from natural minerals (iron ore) It is the mineral aggregates that contain iron or iron compounds which can be used economically

A significant fraction of iron ore used in steel production comes from magnetite deposits.Magnetite iron ore requires significant beneficiation,which typically involves grinding to a particle size where magnetite is liberated from its silicate matrix.And grinding consumes a lot of energy.This article investigates eco efficient alternatives for the process design for magnetite iron ore.Iron Ore Dry Grinding SystemsIron ore grinding can be processed in dry or wet operation.The choice of grinding circuit is based on the density and hardness of the ore to be ground.Although most taconite operations employ rod or mill grinding,a few facilities use autogenous or semi autogenous grinding systems.Autogenous grinding uses coarse pieces of the ore itself as.
