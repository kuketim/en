## Variables in Ball Mill Operation Paul O.Abbe&#174;
Of course there is the possibility of over milling,obtaining a different particle size distribution or a need to change media size or mill speed.A general rule of thumb for mill scale up is √(𝑑 𝐷),where d is the size of the smaller mill and D the inside diameter of the larger mill.Feed Size VS Ball SizeA ball diameter that grabs the particle must exceed the particle by 25 times to achieve this semi self locking taper.One can argue the f50 is a more realistic value since balls wear and the average ball size might be closer to half the maximum.Then the multiple would be closer to 13 times the maximum particle size fed to the ball mill.
