## Difference between Concrete and Cement
There is not much difference between concrete and cement.The mixture of aggregates and paste is basically the concrete,cement is an ingredient of concrete.Th The concrete is basically made from four ingredients that are mixed with a specific ratio.1: Cement: The binder used to hold the other materials is known as cement.Concrete and Screed: What's the Difference? Ready Mix …Concrete and screed are similar in some respects.They are both made from the same basic materials: cement,water and aggregate (sand,stone or gravel).But,when it comes to their uses as building materials,concrete and screed are very different.Quality.

## The effect of stone dust content in sand
Depending on the magnitude of both,stone dust may be favorable or unfavorable to mortar strength.(2) At the early age (7 and 28 days),the effect of stone dust on the hydration rate of cement is marked while at later ages it becomes less significant.No detrimental effects appear until six months later.26 Different Types of Concrete; [Its Classification,Uses.7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Ferro cement consists of closely spaced wire meshes which are impregnated with a rich mix of cement mortar.Usually,0.5 to 1.0 mm diameter steel wires are formed into meshes.Mortar 1:2 to 1:3 with a water cement ratio of 0.4 to 0.45 is poured into the form work with fabricated steel by using layers of the wire mesh.

## Concrete mix ratio for various grades of concrete.
We all know that on mixing cement with sand,stone aggregates and water,a paste will form which can be used to bind the building materials together.This paste is also called as concrete.The strength of this concrete mix is determined by the proportion on which these cement,sand,stones or …Sand and Gravel in Concrete4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;One standard recipe calls for one part of cement to two parts of sand to four parts of gravel.This results in a C rated concrete mix,which means the concrete will be of medium strength.Concrete is rated on a system that indicates the strength of the mix after it’s cured for approximately a month.
