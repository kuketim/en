## Land degradation and rehabilitation in coastal sand …
Mining of sand for extraction of heavy minerals only removes about 1% of the bulk of the sand,the rest being returned to the dunes in some form or other.Modern sand miners are required to reshape and revegetate the dune systems and leave them as close as possible to their original state (Unwin &amp; Cook,1986 cited in Burdett,1994 ).Heavy Minerals Processing Plant Design,Machine &amp; Install,…Sometimes heavy minerals are not easy to be separated by common processing technologies,then electrical separation may be another choice.It takes advantages of the electrical conductivity differences of different heavy minerals,for example,rutile can be easily recovered by electric separation.
