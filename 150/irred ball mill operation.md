## IsaMill
The IsaMill is an energy efficient mineral industry grinding mill that was jointly developed in the 1990s by Mount Isa Mines Limited (&quot;MIM&quot;,a subsidiary of MIM Holdings Limited and now part of the Glencore Xstrata group of companies) and Netzsch Feinmahltechnik (&quot;Netzsch&quot;),…Mill (grinding)A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.
