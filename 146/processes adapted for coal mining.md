## The Influence of Coal Mining on Water Resources in the.
Coal mining exerts serious effects on water resources in the Yellow River Basin,and also has influence on discharge into the Yellow River.It is very important for the Yellow River health to study the effects of coal mining on hydrological cycle and runoff change.28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Fig.Data mining process 1.1.Data Acquisition process The data is acquired from coal mines where the blasting processes for mines are performed.The spacing (M) denotes the space between holes.The class label Boulder denotes after the blasting the size of boulder produced in blasting.1.2.Data Pre processingLand Disturbance and Reclamation after MiningThis chapter discusses land disturbance and reclamation after mining.It presents a classification of land disturbance because of coal mining that is adapted from a more general and comprehensive classification of Motorina and Ovchinnikov and Bauer and Weinitschke.Steeply dipping coal mines use the terrace mining method due to the nature of the coal seams within the deposit.These mines can be geologically complex,involve many thin seams and involve intricate coal mining methods.Therefore they present a number of challenges not …
