## A model for simulating vibration responses of …
The objective of this study was to develop a vibration model of a grinding machine workpiece hand arm system.A lumped parameter model structure of the system was proposed,and its major parameters were determined using the mechanical impedance measured at the grinding point of a typical workpiece (golf club head) held by two hands and referenced to the vibration transmissibility spectra.Surface Topography of Fine grained ZrO 2 Ceramic by Two.By AFM images,the surface topography and the micro structure of the two dimensional ultrasonic vibration grinding ceramics were especially analyzed.The experimental results indicate that the surface roughness is related to grinding vibration mode and the
