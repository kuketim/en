## The Oxidation Pretreatment of a Sulfidic Refractory Gold …
Abstract: An attempt has been made to study the pretreatment of sulfidic refractory gold ore with pyrolusite.The inﬂuences of various parameters were studied to optimize the conditions.The optimum leaching conditions were pyrolusite gold ore mass ratio of 3.0,H 2 SO 4 concentration of 3.0 M,temperature of 100 C,particle size of 45μm,stirring speed of 200 rpm.Leaching Guide of Refractory Gold OreWith the development of beneficiation technology,the definition of refractory gold ore is changing.Generally speaking,refractory gold ore in leaching field is a kind of ore whose leaching rate of gold is less than 80% when directly processed by cyanidation after find
