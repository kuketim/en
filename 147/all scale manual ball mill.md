## Ball Milling in Organic Synthesis: Solutions and Challanges
Type of ball mill: • There is no fundamental restriction to the type of ball mill used for organic synthesis (planetary ball mill,mixer ball mill,vibration ball mill,…).• The scale of reaction determines the size and the type of ball mill.• VeEmaxThe High Energy Ball Mill Emax combines high frequency impact,intensive friction,and controlled circular jar movements to a unique and highly effective size reduction mechanism.The grinding jars have an oval shape and are mounted on two discs respectively which move the jars on a circular course without changing their orientation.

## Ball Mills
In all ore dressing and milling Operations,including flotation,cyanidation,gravity concentration,and amalgamation,the Working Principle is to crush and grind,often with rob mill &amp; ball mills,the ore in order to liberate the minerals.In the chemical and process industries,grinding is an important step in preparing raw materials for subsequent treatment.Ball MillsBall mills can be used to further break down or refine a single material,or you can place multiple materials into a ball mill jar to mix as you pulverize this is a very common industrial solution for mixing glazes that require the smallest of mesh sizes.Ball mills basically function like a mortar and pestle,but on a much larger scale.
