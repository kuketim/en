## What is a commutator?
The commutator itself is a split ring,typically made of copper,with each segment of the ring attached to each end of the armature coil.If the armature has multiple coils,the commutator will similarly have multiple segments—one for each end of each coil.GCSE CHEMISTRY27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Extraction of Metals.Extraction of Copper.Copper is sometimes found as native metal.Copper ores include copper(II) oxide and copper(II) sulfide.Copper(II) oxide can be reduced by reaction with carbon.Some copper ores may contain only small amounts of copper.These are called low grade ores and have less than 1% copper but they are still used because copper is so valuable.

Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.AC induction motors How AC motors workInduction motors in practice What controls the speed of an AC motor? In synchronous AC motors,the rotor turns at exactly the same speed as the rotating magnetic field; in an induction motor,the rotor always turns at a lower speed than the field,making it an example of what's called an asynchronous AC motor.The theoretical speed of the rotor in an induction motor depends on the frequency of.

## Types of Chemical Reactions (With Examples)
A chemical reaction is a process generally characterized by a chemical change in which the starting materials (reactants) are different from the products.Chemical reactions tend to involve the motion of electrons,leading to the formation and breaking of chemical bonds.There are several different types of chemical reactions and more than one way of classifying them.DEFINITIONS OF OXIDATION AND REDUCTION (REDOX)23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This page looks at the various definitions of oxidation and reduction (redox) in terms of the transfer of oxygen,hydrogen and electrons.It also explains the terms oxidising agent and reducing agent.An oxidising agent is substance which oxidises something else.In the above example,the iron(III.
