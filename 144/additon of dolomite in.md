## USE OF DOLOMITE AS AN AUXILIARY FLUX IN FLOOR …
The present investigation involved a study of the use of dolomite in floor‐tile bodies.A review of the literature showed that little or no work has been done in this field,and it was,therefore,necessary to follow somewhat closely investigations carried on in the vitreous sanitary ware and dinnerware fields to determine the optimum percentages of dolomite to be incorporated in the test.What Is Dolomite Used for With Plants? Home Guides SF …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Dolomite limestone is best used to change the acidity,or pH,of the soil.Start with a soil pH test,which you can buy at garden centers,to determine the existing pH.Most plants.
