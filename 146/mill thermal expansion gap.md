## Thermal Expansion The Physics Hypertextbook
Thermal expansion is a small,but not always insignificant effect.Typical coefficients are measured in parts per million per kelvin (10 −6 K).That means your typical classroom meter stick never varies in length by more than a 100 &#181;m in its entire lifetime — probably never more than 10 &#181;m while students are using it.measurement techniques
