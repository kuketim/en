## Activated Carbons from Hydrochars Prepared in Milk
After extraction with acetone,the fraction of saturated carbons in HC CH M fell,and the extract itself was a dark viscous oil.There are likely multiple reasons for the larger mineral content of the activated carbons produced from milk derived hydrochars as compared with activated carbons prepared from hydrochars generated in water.First.The preparation of activated carbon from5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;the pH of some of the prepared activated carbons reached a value of 11.Phenol adsorption results for the different activated carbons prepared corresponded well to the results obtained for the Norit RO 0.8 activated carbon sample.Keywords activated carbon,precious metal,South African coal,surface area,phenol adsorption.
