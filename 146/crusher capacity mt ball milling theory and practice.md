## Ball Mill
For ball milling,there is an optimum speed where the centrifugal force at the top of the mill is just balanced by the force of gravity.This caused the balls to be lifted to the maximum height before they fall onto the balls below,thus imparting the most kinetic energy.In practice,the ball mill is run at just belowTECHNICAL NOTES 8 GRINDING R.P.Kingthe mill is used primarily to lift the load (medium and charge).Additional power is required to keep the mill rotating.8.1.3 Power drawn by ball,semi autogenous and autogenous mills A simplified picture of the mill load is shown in Figure 8.3 Ad this can be used to establ
