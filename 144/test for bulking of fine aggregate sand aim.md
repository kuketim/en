## BULKING OF FINE AGGREGATE
The volume increase of fine aggregate due to presence of moisture content is known as bulking.Fine sand bulks more as compared to coarse sand.Extremely fine sand particularly the manufactured fine aggregate bulks as much as about 40%.Note: Fine aggregate do not show any bulking when it is absolutely dry or completely saturated.Process for executing Bulking Test for Fine Aggregate …While applying fine aggregate (sand) to produce concrete,it is essential to find out the quantity of used sand that has been bulked.It is done with bulking test.This test is dependent on the fact that when damp sand bulks,the volume of saturated sand entirely immersed with water is identical though the sand …
