## Role of Organic Acids in Detoxification of Aluminum in …
The action of genes related to the metabolism and secretion of organic acids seems to be involved in this pattern.Internal detoxification of Al in Al accumulating plants is achieved by the formation of Al organic acid complex.For instance,the complex of AlRole of micronutrient elements in the metabolism of …Role of Micronutrient Elements in the Metabolism of Higher Plants.I.Changes in Oxidative Enzyme Constitution of Tomato Leaves Deficient in Micronutrient Elements1 Alvin Nason,Henry A.Oldewurtel2 and Lois M.Propst From the McCollum Pratt Institute,The Johns Hopkins University,Baltimore,Maryland Received Novem INTRODUCTION It has been suggested that the extremely …Manganese (Mn) is an essential element for plant growth due to its participation in a series of physiological and metabolic processes.Mn is also considered a heavy metal that causes phytotoxicity when present in excess,disrupting photosynthesis and enzyme activity in plants.Thus,Mn toxicity is a major constraint limiting plant growth and production,especially in acid soils.To cope with.
