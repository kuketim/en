## Circulating Load Calculation Formula
Here is a formula that allows you to calculate the circulating load ratio around a ball mill and hydrocylone as part of a grinding circuit.For example your ball mill is in closed circuit with a set of cyclones.The grinding mill receives crushed ore feed.The pulp densities around your cyclone are sampled and known over an 8 hour shift,allowing to calculate corresponding to circulating load.Circulating Load Calculation FormulaHere is a formula that allows you to calculate the circulating load ratio around a ball mill and hydrocylone as part of a grinding circuit.For example your ball mill is in closed circuit with a set of cyclones.The grinding mill receives crushed ore feed.The pulp densities around your cyclone are sampled and known over an 8 hour shift,allowing t

## Ball Mill: Operating principles,components,Uses.
A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis.The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 50%IsaMillThe IsaMill is a stirred medium grinding mill,in which the grinding medium and the ore being ground are stirred rather than being subjected to the tumbling action of older high throughput mills (such as ball mills and rod mills).Stirred mills often consist of stirrers mounted on a rotating shaft located along the central axis of the mill.
