## Manganese carbonate nanoparticles mediated mitochondrial,
The cubic manganese carbonate nanoparticles (MnCO 3 NPs) are prepared by a simple synthesis method for enhanced sonodynamic therapy It is proved that the high sonodynamic performance of MnCO 3 NPs is related to its band gap The CO 2 and Mn ions produced by the degradation can achieve ultrasonic cavitation and activate the mitochondrial cell apoptosis,Sciencemadness Discussion Board&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;i made manganese nitrate from the carbonate + ammonium nitrate (from fertilizer) by this method,which requires no nitric acid.manganese nitrate is very soluble,even more so than ammonium nitrate,which makes recrystallization a pain (i wasn't able to obtain a crystalline product).however,a mix that only contains ammonium nitrate (which decomposes to a gas when heated) as impurity is good.
