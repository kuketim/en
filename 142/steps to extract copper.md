## What is Bioleaching? (with pictures)
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Bioleaching is the use of bacterial microorganisms to extract precious metals,such as gold,from ore in which it is embedded.As an alternative to smelting or roasting,miners use bioleaching when there are lower concentrations of metal in ore and they need an efficient,environmentally responsible method to extract it.Extracting iron and copper&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Copper is an example of this.Copper mostly occurs as sulfide ores,which are heated in air to convert them to copper(II) oxide.Molten copper can be produced from copper(II) oxide by heating.

## copper extraction and purification
Extracting copper from its ores The method used to extract copper from its ores depends on the nature of the ore.Sulphide ores such as chalcopyrite are converted to copper by a different method from silicate,carbonate or sulphate ores.Getting copper from 2Copper Mining and Extraction Sulfide OresCopper minerals and ore are found throughout the Earth’s crust.They occur in both sedimentary and igneous rocks.The outer 10 km of the crust contains 33 g of copper for every tonne of rock.This is not enough to make it commercially viable to extract the rock.
