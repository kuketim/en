## Ball Mill Loading
The starting point for ball mill media and solids charging generally starts as follows: 50% media charge; Assuming 26% void space between spherical balls (non spherical,irregularly shaped and mixed size media will increase or decrease the free space) 50% x 26% = 13% free space; Add to this another 10% 15% above the bHow to Handle the Charge Volume of a Ball Mill or Rod Mill.The charge volume of a ball or rod mill is expressed as the percentage of the volume within the liners filled with balls or rods.We will write a custom essay sample on How to Handle the Charge Volum
