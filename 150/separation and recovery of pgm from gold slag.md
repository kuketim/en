## Process for the extraction of platinum group metals.
11&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A process for separating platinum group metals (PGM's) from various feedstock materials,is disclosed,wherein a plasma arc flame is employed to produce a superheated puddle on the surface of a slag layer to accelerate the association of platinum group metals with a collector material and formation of a recoverable layer of platinum group metals and collector material.Processing,smelting and refining gold World Gold …7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The two gold refining methods most commonly employed to derive pure gold are: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process.The Miller process uses gaseous chlorine to extract impurities when gold is at melting point; impurities separate into a layer on the surface of the molten purified gold.
