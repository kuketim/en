## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow cgrinding energy limestone greencampuses.inenergy consumption in limestone ball mill meegoturkiye.org.how to calculate the energy consumption of a ball mill.MODELING THE SPECIFIC GRINDING ENERGY AND BALL.
