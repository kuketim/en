American.There are four main mining methods: underground,open surface (pit),placer,and in situ mining.Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels,beach sands,or other environments.

## Extraction of iron by the blast furnace process.
Iron does not exist on the Earth as an element,but rather in the form of its oxides and sulphides in iron ore.They are the starting materials for the technical extraction of pig iron in the blast furnace.The blast furnace operates at 1900 °C in order to smelt iron from iron ore.How iron is madeMethods for manufacturing steel have evolved significantly since industrial production began in the late 19th century.Modern methods,however,are still based on the same premise as the original Bessemer Process,which uses oxygen to lower the carbon content in iron.

D.5 What causes imperialism? In a word: power.Imperialism is the process by which one country dominates another directly,by political means,or indirectly,by economic means,in order to steal its wealth (either natural or produced).The Extraction of Iron Chemistry LibreTextsExtracting iron from iron ore using a Blast Furnace.The common ores of iron are both iron oxides,and these can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke.Coke is produced by heating coal in the absence of air.Coke is cheap and provides both the reducing agent for the reaction and also the heat source.

## The Extraction of Iron
Cast iron has already been mentioned above.This section deals with the types of iron and steel which are produced as a result of the steel making process.Wrought iron: If all the carbon is removed from the iron to give high purity iron,it is known as wrought iron.Wrought iron is quite soft and easily worked and has little structural strength.Extraction of Iron Metallurgy Blast Furnace and ReactionsThe extraction of iron from its ore is a long and subdued process,that helps in separating the useful components from the waste materials such as slag.What happens in the Blast Furnace? The purpose of a Blast Furnace is to reduce the concentrated ore chemically to its liquid metal state.

## Metal Profile: Iron Properties and Characteristics
 · Modern extraction techniques use blast furnaces,which are characterized by their tall stacks (chimney like structures).The iron is poured into the stacks along with coke (carbon rich coal) and limestone (calcium carbonate).Nowadays,the iron ore normally goes through a process of sintering before entering the stack.
