## Variable speed wind turbine
A variable speed wind turbine is one which is specifically designed to operate over a wide range of rotor speeds.It is in direct contrast to fixed speed wind turbine where the rotor speed is approximately constant.The reason to vary the rotor speed is to capture the maximum aerodynamic power in the wind,as the wind speed varies.Enabling wind turbines to operate at high wind speedsOperation above cut out speed.Wind turbines are enabled to operate at speeds above the cut out speed by derating.Derated operation is the ability of a wind turbine or an entire wind plant to operate below its maximum capacity during times of high wind speed.

## Water turbine
A water turbine is a rotary machine that converts kinetic energy and potential energy of water into mechanical work.Water turbines were developed in the 19th century and were widely used for industrial power prior to electrical grids.Now they are mostly used for electric power generation.Water turbines are mostly found in dams to generate electric power from water kinetic energy.Introducing Harmony VAWT a brand new Vertical Axis Wind.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;These turbine blades will be coupled with my special generator
