## What is dry process in cement manufacturing?
In dry process for manufacturing of cement,the raw materials are dried and reduced in size to a fine powder in to grinding mill.The dry powder is called the raw meal.The raw meal is pumped into a blending silo.The raw meal is blended by passin.What Are the Differences Between the Wet and Dry …What Are the Differences Between the Wet and Dry Processes of a Cement Manufacturer? The wet process of cement manufacturing involves adding water to finely crushed raw material,such as limestone,clay or iron ore,in a proportion of 35 to 50 percent water to 50 to 65 percent raw material to make a slurry that is fed into a cement kiln,whereas no water is added in the dry process.
