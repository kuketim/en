## Rock Crushing Rule of Thumb
Nearly all crushers produce a product that is 40% finer than one half the crusher setting.Source: Babu and Cook; The product of a jaw crusher will have a size distribution such that the 80% fraction size (d80) is slightly less than the open side setting of the crusher.For example,if the open side setting is 6 inches,the d80 product size will be 5&#190; inches.Types of CrushersCrushers may be divided into three general classes,with respect to the manner in which they do their work: Pressure Crushers: This category embraces the several types of gyratory crushers and jaw crushers,as well as the double crushing rolls,with either smooth or corrugated shells.Impact Crushers: This division is represented chiefly by the various styles of hammermill; also by the cage.
