## Ball Mill
The discharge port may be covered by a grate to prevent oversized ore exiting the mill,or it may have no grate (overflow type ball mill).As the balls wear due to abrasion,they are replaced with new balls (‘green’ balls).If large particle sizes are retrieved from the ball mill,the process is known as a ‘coarse grind’.Ball millThe ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials,and it is widely used in production lines for powders such as cement,silicates,refractory material,fertilizer,glass ceramics,etc.as well as for ore dressing of both ferrous and non ferrous metals.of both ferrous and non ferrous metals.
