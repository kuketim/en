## Designing Inclined Screw Conveyors for Industrial.
A screw conveyor with tubular housing and reduced pitch screw (1 2 or 2 3) is recommended for most applications.Loss in efficiency can also be overcome by increasing the speed or the diameter of the screw conveyor.Screw Conveyors Thomas and Muller SystemsScrew conveyors can range from simple diverters to conveyors moving materials long distances in one direction.Along its length the conveyor may have several discharges.
