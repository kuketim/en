## Basalt Wikipedia
The modern petrological term basalt describing a particular composition of lava derived rock originates from its use by Georgius Agricola in 1556 in his famous work of mining and mineralogy De re metallica,libri XII Agricola applied "basalt" to the volcanic black rock of the Schlo&#223;berg.Basalt Fibers: Alternative to Glass? : CompositesWorldBasalt Fibers: Alternative to Glass?,temperatures and won't deposit on its counterpart (either the disc or brake drum) in the braking system Continuous basalt fibers also are in use as reinforcement in other conventional composite structur,Project engineers use a computerized system to calculate the advantages and disadvantages,

## Experimental investigation of the mechanical properties,
The splitting tensile strength of concrete is improved by 15% when basalt fibers with 2% volume fraction are added to the concrete mix A significant increase of up to 75% is noticed in the flexural tensile strength of basalt FRC,with better post peak residual strength compared with the plain concretebasalt fibre SlideShareDISADVANTAGES OF BASALT FIBER The price of fibers made from basalt is higher than those made of E glass The American Concrete Institute,Canadian Standards Association,International Federation for Structural Concrete and other internationally recognized engineering code authorities have not provided specific design guidance for its use
