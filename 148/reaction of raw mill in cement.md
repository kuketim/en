&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Kiln is a huge rotating furnace also called as the heart of cement making process.Here,raw material is heated up to 1450 ⁰C.This temperature begins a chemical reaction so called decarbonation.In this reaction material (like limestone) releases the carCement ProductionThe clinker is a kiln outlet,which is the main cement ingredient The limestone is used only for the cement production,for certain cement types,in the cement mill as a mineral component.The raw materials from the depo centre are transported to the vertical roller mill,where raw meal is produced.The storage of this raw meal consists of 2 silos.
