## Modeling breakage rates of coarse particles in ball mills.
Breakage rates of coarse particles in ball mills generally follow non first order kinetics and the distribution products from batch milling are often characterized by significant contributions of abrasion besides breakage by impact,which are not well described using traditional size mass balance formulations.Laboratory Ball Mill PlansSince a rod mill will accept a coarser feed than a ball mill,it fits in naturally as the intermediate comminution step.However,rod mills,like crushers,must be operated under controlled conditions to obtain maximum efficiency and are more difficult to operate than ball mills.

In wear resistant steel ball grinding,in the condition of the same grinding fineness,grain size more coarse,the ball mill production ability is lower; Feed particle is smaller,it has a higher production capacity.But one thing should be paid attention to: when asked coarser grinding ball mill productivity vary with feedFC Bond Millgrams per revolution (Gbp) is the ball mill grindability.The ball mill work index,Wi (kWh short ton) is calculated from the following equation (Bond 1961):1 The mill should be cleaned by either blowing air into it or wiping the interior with a cloth and or brush.
