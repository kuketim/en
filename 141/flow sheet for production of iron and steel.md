## Steel Production American Iron and Steel Institute
How Steel Is Made Steel is primarily produced using one of two methods: Blast Furnace or Electric Arc Furnace The blast furnace is the first step in producing steel from iron oxid The first blast furnaces appeared in the 14th century and produced one ton per day Even though equipment is improved and higher production rates can be achieved.IRON AND STEEL&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;This page looks at the use of the Blast Furnace in the extraction of iron from iron ore,and the conversion of the raw iron from the furnace into various kinds of steel.The common ores of iron are both iron oxides,and these can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke.

## Steelmaking
Steelmaking is the process of producing steel from iron ore and or scrap.In steelmaking,impurities such as nitrogen,silicon,phosphorus,sulfur and excess carbon (most important impurity) are removed from the sourced iron,and alloying elements such as manganese,nickel,chromium,carbon and vanadium are added to produce different grades of steel.AN OVERVIEW OF STEEL SECTORJPC: updated in July 2017 1 AN OVERVIEW OF STEEL SECTOR Global Scenario In 2016,the world crude steel production reached 1630 million tonnes (mt) and showed a growth of 0.6% over 2015.China remained world’s largest crude steel producer in
