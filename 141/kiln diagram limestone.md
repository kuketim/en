## Lime Production: Industry Profile
Limestone is converted into lime through heating in a kiln,a process known as calcination.When limestone is subjected to high temperatures,it undergoes a chemical decomposition resulting in the formation of lime (CaO) and the emission of carbon dioxide 2).Lime kiln&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Limestone was crushed (often by hand) to fairly uniform 60 mm (1 to 2.5 inch) lumps fine stone was rejected.Successive dome shaped layers of coal and limestone were built up in the kiln on.
