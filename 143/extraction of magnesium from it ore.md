## Magnesium: extraction Metalpedia
Magnesium: extraction; Brife introduction; Magnesium is found in solution in sea water (about 1.3 kg m magnesium) and in natural brines.It is also found extensively in the ores magnesite (MgCO3) and dolomite (MgCO3.CaCO3).Both of the two types of resources can be used as raw materials to manufacture magnesium metal.How Is Magnesium Metal Produced? The BalanceThe first magnesium metal extracted from seawater was produced by Dow Chemicals at their Freeport,Texas plant in 1948.The Freeport facility operated until 1998,but,presently,the only remaining salt water magnesium producer is the Dead Sea Magnesium Ltd.(Israel)—a joint venture between Israel Chemicals Ltd.and Volkswagen AG.
