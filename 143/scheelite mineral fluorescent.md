Geology Page2020510&ensp&#0183&enspMineral fluorescence is caused by a wide array of activators.In some situations,the activator concentration must be restricted to below a certain level,to prevent the fluorescent emission from quenching.In addition,the mineral must be free of impurities such as iron or copper,in order to prevent possible fluorescence from quenching.
