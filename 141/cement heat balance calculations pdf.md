## Energy balance and cogeneration for a cement plant
The cement industry is an energy intensive industry consuming about 4 GJ per tonne of cement produced.A thermodynamic analysis for cogeneration using the waste heat streams is not easily available.Data from a working 1 Mt per annum plant in India is used to obtain an energy balance for the system and a Sankey diagram is drawn.How To Calculate Heat Balance Sheet For IC EngineHow to calculate heat Balance Sheet For IC Engine The results of the above calculations are tabulated in a table and this table is known as “Heat Balance Sheet” It is generally practice to represent the heat distribution as percentage of heat supplied This is also tabulated in the same heat balance,

## Heat and Material Balance
Heat balance calculations are usually carried out when developing new chemical processes and improving old ones,because no process can work if too much heat is released or if there is a lack of thermal energy to maintain the reaction temperature.This module.
