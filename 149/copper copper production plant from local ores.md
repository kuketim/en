## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper …
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.Chapter 6 Copper Production Technology20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Chapter 6 Copper Production Technology The last boomin technological innovation for the copper industry occurred in the first two dec ades of this century,whenopen pit mining,flo tation concentration,and the reverberatory smelter were adapted to porphyry copper ores.With the exception of leaching solvent extrac
