## Coal Combustion Wastes
Background.Burning coal produces a variety of solid wastes known as coal combustion waste or coal combustion products.These include coal ash (fly ash and bottom ash),boiler slag,and flue gas desulphurization products.In 2007 over 120 million tons of these wastes were produced in the US,of which approximately 44% was reused in other applications.Mapping mountaintop coal mining's yearly spread in …The coal industry may have declined in the last decade because of the rise of cheap natural gas,but a coal mining method called mountaintop removal is still taking place,particularly in central.
