## Hardrock Mining Techniques Underground …
Cut and Fill mining is a method of short hole mining used in narrow ore zones.An access ramp is driven off the main level to the bottom of the ore zone to be accessed.Using development mining techniques a drift is driven through the ore to the defined limit of mining.Cut and fill mining Britannica2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In mining: Cut and fill mining.This system can be adapted to many different ore body shapes and ground conditions.Together with room and pillar mining,it is …

## Post Pillar Design for Overhand Cut and Fill Mining in.
Selective mining,such as post pillar cut and fill,is used in large,flat,irregularly shaped ore bodies where ground stability is to be maintained.This selective mining is used to open the stope to the full lateral extent of the ore body in order to minimize the dilution and maximise the recovery.Drift and Fill The High Value,High Recovery Mining.The drift and fill method can be applied to a variety of underground mining situations and is a preferred method for some orebody geometries and where ore recovery is viewed as a key to project success.This paper examines some of the critical mine planning and backfill issues involved with the drift and fill mining method.
