## Experimental investigation of the power draw of tumbling.
A power analyser was utilized to measure mill power.Increase in mill speed and ball filling leads to a remarkable increase in the amount of the power.Preliminary results show that there is a definite trend between the power and the slurry filling U.Mill power draw is maximum at slurry concentration 60 70% and slurry filling 0.84.Powder millPowder mills were originally powered by windmills,water mills or horse mills.Despite later availability of steam engines,the older power sources did not require a fire to generate steam,and avoided the possibility of sparks which might ignite the gunpowder.

## Mill (grinding)
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.horse mill),wind or water ().Cement millA cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage) is the equipment used to grind the hard,nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement.Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more e

## Optimization of mill performance by using
The performance of tumbling mills is sensitive to the volumetric mill filling which influences grinding media wear rates,throughput,power draw,and product grind size from the circuit.Each of these performance parameters peaks at different filling values.InOperational work index for grinding plants&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Then,for this case FTBE is given by: (2.44 0.2 FrBe = 1.4&quot; ~E) (4) The diameter DE in (4) of the equivalent unitary ball is found using the power draw equation for wet grinding ball mills (Rowland,1982): Pv = 5.7 * D3 3.3 D4 E +14&quot;9.DE 0.6&quot; E (5) Using the

## WO2014113279A1
[0010] U.S.Patent 3,773,268 to Bond discloses an apparatus for and a method of controlling the feed rate of grinding media to a grinding mill of the type that operates at a power draft in the vicinity of the critical peak power draft of the grinding mill.Vertimill&#174;Motor power and media addition.The power drawn by the Vertimill motor is required to establish the grinding rate.Motor power should be measured using corrected power.As the grinding media wears fine enough to be carried out by the uprising velocity in the mill,the total media charge will diminish,and the power draw will decrease.
