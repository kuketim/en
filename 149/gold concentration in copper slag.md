## Copper Slag
Copper slag,or fayalite slag,is a by product obtained during the matte smelting,converting and refining of copper (Fig.7.11).54,59 It has been estimated that for every tonne of copper produced,about 2.2 tonnes of slag is generated,60 as a consequence of the relatively low grades of copper concentrates now available.The global production of refined copper over the past eight years is.Extraction Of Copper Mining,Concentration,…Copper Smelting means that the concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica),calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and air in a furnace.The major steps in the extraction of copper are.Copper in Chalcopyrite is reduced to copper sulfide.Just like in Blast Furnaces,calcium carbonate is added as a flux to create the slag.
