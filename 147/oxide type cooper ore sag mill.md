## Porphyry Copper Ore In The Barmac Vsi And Sag Mill
BALL MILL ball mill is a new energy saving equipment which has two ways of grinding: the dry way and the wet way,SBM's ball mill can offer you the high standard quality and technical helpAccording to different extracting way of mine,ball mill can be divided into two types,they are tabular type and flowing typeMine Engineer.Com provides mining,gold,copper,coal.There are two distinct types of copper ore,the sulfide ore and the oxide ore.The sulfide ores are beneficiated in flotation cells,while the oxide ores are generally leached.First the copper ore from a open pit mine is blasted,loaded and transported to the primary crushers.
