## Design Guide
3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Divide the belt pitch length by the tooth pitch selected and round the result to the nearest whole number.This is the number of teeth on the belt for your application.Adjust the nominal center distance of your drive design to match the belt using Formula 1 in Table 1.Step 6.Using Formula 6 in Table 1,calculate the effective tension (Te) onV Belt Drive Selection HandbookWith reference to a belt drive system,the formula to find rim speed,or belt speed,is: Rim Speed [ft min] = Pulley Diameter [in] x π x RPM x 1 12 [ft in] OR FPM = Pulley Diameter [in] x 0.2618 x RPM Power In mechanical engineering,power is a measure of performance or capacity and is defined as the amount of work performed in a given time.
