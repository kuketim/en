## Ferronickel
The combined nickel yield into ferronickel is 88% to 93%.Among alternative technologies of ferronickel smelting and refining,blowing molten iron and nickel ore mixture with reducing gas (Krasheninnikov and Leontiev,2001) might be mentioned.The addition of 20% limestone allowed an increase of nickel content in the metal to 70%,in slag &lt;0.1%.Electric Smelting Furnace of Ore1 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Considerable space is given in Lyon and Keeney report to the electric smelting of iron ores in Sweden,which,we may say,is the only country in which such metallurgical work is being done on a large scale.The plant at Trollhattan cost $93,000 and the results were fairly satisfactory and improving.The ore carried up to 68 percent iron.
