## Compressive Strength of Concrete Cube Test,…
Compressive strength of Concrete and its importance: As we all know that concrete is a mixture of sand,cement,and aggregate.The strength of the concrete depends upon many factors like individual compressive strength of its constituents (Cement,Sand,aggregate),quality of materials used,air entrainment mix proportions,water cement ratio,curing methods and temperature effects.Tensile Strength of ConcreteUniaxial Tensile Test: This is a direct tension test in which a concrete specimen is held at the ends and pulled apart,inducing uniaxial tensile stress in it.uniaxial tensile test id one of the difficult and complicated tests to perfume on concrete but gives the true tensile strength of concrete.
