## Ore Compression
Hello,I'm currently in the following location: Solar System Airkio Constellation Karnola Region Lonetrek I want to be able to find a place reasonably close place where I can compress ore.I did so at the Kentucky Fried Chicken station in Airkio (yes,that is its actual name) but some time during the past 24 hours they removed that service so I can't do it there anymore.Reference : Mining GuideEntry level Mining Ships Any ship that can fit a mining laser can mine.If it is a combat ship,mined ore goes into that ship's cargo hold.Cruisers and battleships are now rarely used to mine,since mining barges and exhumers perform the same function better.
