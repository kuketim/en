Reference.comThe reason the density of steel is given as a range rather than a singular number is because steel is an alloy containing both iron and carbon atoms.The percentage of each element used in steel varies and impacts the density of the metal.Alloys with higher amounts of iron have a higher density because iron is more dense than carbon.
