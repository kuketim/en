## BENEFICIATION OF LOW GRADE GRAPHITE ORE OF EASTERN INDIA BY TWO STAGE GRINDING AND FLOTATION
In froth flotation,graphite ores are often subjected to a suitable hydrocarbon oil treatment to alter their hydrophobicity,enhance recovery,and or improve selectivity [13].Conventionally,the collector used in most of the flotation circuit is dieselThe Application of Xanthate in Froth Flotation ProcessXanthate Application in Pyrite Froth Flotation In flotation of pyrite with xanthate,butyl xanthate is usually used.Generally,after the activator (copper sulfate) is added to the pulp,the mixed emulsifier of xanthate,pine oil and water can be added at one time,which is better than the multiple addition of the flotation reagent,and the dosage of the flotation reagent will be saved.
