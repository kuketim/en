## Sodium hydroxide NaOH PubChem
Sodium hydroxide solution appears as a colorless liquid.More dense than water.Contact may severely irritate skin,eyes,and mucous membranes.Corrosive to metals and tissue.At room temperature,sodium hydroxide is a white crystalline odorless solid that absorbs moisture from the air.It is a manufactured substance.Technologies for Arsenic Removal from Water: Current. · Among the five alkaline solutions studied (i.e.NaOH,Na 2 CO 3,Na 2 HPO 4,NaHCO 3,and NaOAc),0.1 M NaOH showed the highest desorption efficiency of 90%.Moreover,desorption was proven to be affected by pH and the concentration of the alkaline solution.By increasing the concentration of NaOH to 1 M,full desorption of arsenate was achieved.

Bauxite ore occurrence Bauxite ore is formed from the intense lateritic weathering of residual clays,which accumulate in topographic lows on continental surfaces.13 Bauxite deposits can be classified according to their geological formation into lateritic (89%),karst (10%) and Tikhvin‐type (&lt;1% of world's deposits).60,61 Trace elements,including REE,Ga,Ti,Cr and Zr,can be adsorbed.Silicon dioxideSilicon dioxide,also known as silica,is an oxide of silicon with the chemical formula Si O 2,most commonly found in nature as quartz and in various living organisms.In many parts of the world,silica is the major constituent of sand.SiO 2 Molar mass 60.08 g mol

## The Transformation of Bauxite to Aluminum (and the.
In a process known as digestion,after any silica has been removed,the remaining bauxite ore is combined with a hot caustic soda material in a heated pressure vessel in order to dissolve the aluminum bearing minerals,yielding a sodium aluminate solution: Al2O3 + 2 NaOH > 2 NaAlO2 + H2O.Once this reaction has occurred,bauxite residue can be.Sodium hydroxide NaOHSodium hydroxide is also known as lye or soda,or caustic soda.At room temperature,sodium hydroxide is a white crystalline odorless solid that absorbs moisture from the air.It is a synthetically manufactured substance.When dissolved in water or neutralized with acid it releases substantial amounts of heat,which may prove sufficient to ignite combustible materials.

## Mining and Refining Process
The pressure is not important for the process as such,but is defined by the steam saturation pressure of the process.At 240&#176;C the pressure is approximately 3.5 MPa.The slurry is then cooled in a series of flash tanks to around 106&#176;C at atmospheric pressure and by flashing off steam.Bayer processThe Bayer process is the principal industrial means of refining bauxite to produce alumina (aluminium oxide) and was developed by Carl Josef Bayer.Bauxite,the most important ore of aluminium,contains only 30 60% aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3),the rest being a mixture of silica,various iron oxides,and titanium dioxide.
