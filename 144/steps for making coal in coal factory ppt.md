There are four main types of coal,which are formed in a similar manner both formed from decomposed vegetation composed at high temperatures over millions of years beneath layers of sand,rock,and sediment.There are: Anthracite coal: it’s hard coal,which contains 86 97% carbon and mainly used by the metals industry,space heating in addition to generating electricity.What is clean coal technology? HowStuffWorksCoal is the dirtiest of all fossil fuels.When burned,it produces emissions that contribute to global warming,create acid rain and pollute water.With all of the hoopla surrounding nuclear energy,hydropower and biofuels,you might be forgiven for thinking that grimy coal is finally on its way out.
