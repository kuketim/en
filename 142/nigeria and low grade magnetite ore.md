## Iron Ore
In addition,more iron ore concentrates are being produced due to the increasing need for beneficiation to upgrade low grade iron ore resources.Although iron ore concentrates are generally higher in iron grade and contain lower impurities,the finer size distribution of concentrates limits their usage in iron ore …Iron Ore ScienceDirectThis drop in iron ore price is attributed to a cooling of the Chinese economy and an oversupply of iron ore from the major iron ore producers.This has put considerable pressure on the higher cost iron ore producers to reduce costs,and even the major producers such as BHP Billiton,Rio Tinto,Vale,Fortescue Metals Group (FMG),and Kumba Iron Ore at the lower end of the cost curve are under.

## Magnetite
Low grade hematite ores need to be upgraded to achieve the required iron content,which involves more complicated ore beneficiation processes.The level of comminution required for the low grade hematite ore is similar to high grade ores to deliver the same products,lumps and fines.Hematite Processing by FlotationDeposits of comparatively low grade specular hematite amenable to beneficiation by flotation have produced concentrates superior in grade to direct shipping ores.Low grade deposits containing specular hematite (Fe2 O3) as the major iron mineral as low as 25% Fe can be treated with “Sub A” Flotation to produce concentrates that average better than 62% Fe with less than 9% SiO2 and with a.
