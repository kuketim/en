## Difference between lean concrete and PCC Concrete
Lean Concrete The main difference between lean and PCC Concrete is,In lean concrete,the cement content is less compared to the water content in the concrete.It can also say that the ratio of cement content to water and coarse aggregate content is lowConcrete Mix RatiosConcrete mix ratio is a vital topic in concrete mix design.The four basic ingredients for making concrete are: Portland cement,sand,aggregate (stone) and water.The strength of concrete mixture depends on the ratio in which these four ingredients are mixed.

## Concrete
Concrete is strong in compression,as the aggregate efficiently carries the compression load.However,it is weak in tension as the cement holding the aggregate in place can crack,allowing the structure to fail.Reinforced concrete adds either steel reinforcing bars,steel fibers,aramid fibers,carbon fibers,glass fibers,or plastic fibers to carry tensile loads.How to Calculate Quantity for Cement,Sand &amp; Aggregate …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;How to Calculate Quantity for Cement,Sand &amp; Aggregate.In This channel You can Learn about Civil Engineering Update Videos which are using generally in civil Engineering.So please subscribe our.
