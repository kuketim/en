16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Clinker is ground finely,usually interground with gypsum,to produce cement.Particle size of the ground clinker in cement is typically 100?m down to sub micron.There are various ways of controlling the cement particle size,most commonly by cement surface area (eg: 350m2 kg ) but particle size distribution or sieve residue are also sometimes used.Changing and testing pHChanging pH After improving porosity,changing pH is the most common reason for altering soils.Raising and lowering pH both are necessary at times,depending,of course,on the pH with which you’re starting.l Reducing acidity.Liming is the practice of applying an agent to reduce soil acidity (raise pH) and make soils more favorable for plant growth.

## Calcitic Lime vs Dolomite Lime: Which Should You Use?
A thorough application of pulverized limestone tilled into the soil raises the pH to a neutral level,increasing crop yields and improving overall soil health.The main “ingredient” in calcitic lime is calcium carbonate,which is why many people ask if calcium carbonate is the same a limestone.Aggregate tests9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;is finely crushed and mixed with ground limestone.The blended powder is then calcined (fused by great heat) in large rotary kilns to form a hard clinker.The clinker is ground down to make cement powder.Cement is used in an incredible range of building materials such as mortar,paving blocks,engineering brick and concrete.

As glass powder is a amorphous pozzolanic material,when it is used in concrete as cement replacement,it can contribute to the formation of hydration products and C S H gel.According to Shi et al 41 finely ground glass powders exhibit very high pozzolanic activity.The finer the glass powder is,the higher its pozzolanic activity 41,42.Effects of limestone powder on the hydration and.The particle size distributions (PSD) of CSA cement and limestone powder were analyzed by laser particle size analyzer (Malvern Masterizer 2000) and shown in Fig.2.The mean particle size of CSA cement and limestone powder is 17.01 μm and 22.87 μm,respectively.
