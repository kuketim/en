## Acceptance sampling SQC Online
Acceptance sampling is used by industries worldwide for assuring the quality of incoming and outgoing goods Acceptance sampling plans determine the sample size and criteria for accepting or rejecting a batch based on the quality of a sample,Samples from the process are taken every time interval,and their quality measured.Designing a Statistically Sound Sampling PlanSampling Plans zReasons for using different sampling plans: zSimple random sampling (SRS) ensures that all samples of size n are equally likely to be selected units are selected independently can use standard statistics zStratified random sampling ensures that each of the strata are.

## SAMPLING,SAMPLE PREPARATION AND DATA ANALYSIS
Random sampling is often preferred because it avoids human bias in selecting samples and because it facilitates the application of statistics.In s ystematic sampling the samples are drawn systematically with location or time,e.g.every 10th box in a truck may be analyzed,or a sample may be chosen from a conveyor belt every 1 minute.Time to digital converterIn electronic instrumentation and signal processing,a time to digital converter (abbreviated TDC) is a device for recognizing events and providing a digital representation of the time they occurred.For example,a TDC might output the time of arrival for each incoming pulse.Some applications wish to measure the time interval between two.
