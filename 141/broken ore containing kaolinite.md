## Kaolinite: The clay mineral kaolinite information and pictures
Kaolinite is a clay mineral,with a soft consistency and earthy texture.It is easily broken and can be molded or shaped,especially when wet.Kaolinite is a lackluster and uninteresting mineral on its own,but it occasionally forms interesting pseudomorphs,especially after feldspars.s.kaolinite rockThermogravimetry of a kaolinite alunite ore An ore containing kaolinite (Al2O3&#183;2SiO2&#183;2H2O),alunite (KAl3(SO4)2(OH)6),feldspar (KAlSi3O8) and quartz (SiO2) was analysed by TG DTA to determine the miner Kaolinite: Kaolinite mineral information and data.

Experiments have shown that it is possible to obtain a concentrate containing 65% iron,1.8% alumina and 1.4% silica with an iron recovery of 80% from the tailings of Barsuan iron ore plant.LateriteLaterite is a soil and rock type rich in iron and aluminium and is commonly considered to have formed in hot and wet tropical areas.Nearly all laterites are of rusty red coloration,because of high iron oxide content.They develop by intensive and prolonged weathering of the underlying parent rock.
