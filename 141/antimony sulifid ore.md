## Antimony
Antimony is sometimes found native,but more frequently it is found in the sulfide stibnite (Sb 2 S 3) which is the predominant ore mineral.Commercial forms of antimony are generally ingots,broken pieces,granules,and cast cake.TETRAHEDRITE (Copper Antimony Sulfide)Tetrahedrite forms a solid solution series with the rather rare mineral tennantite (Cu12As4S13,Copper Arsenic Sulfide).The two share the same crystal structure but they differ in the percentage of arsenic versus antimony.Antimony rich specimens are tetrahedrite.
