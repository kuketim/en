## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores …
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.COPPER Copper production16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Copper production About 80 % of primary copper production comes from low grade or poor sulfide ores.After enrichment steps,the copper concentrates are usually treated by pyrometallurgical methods.Generally,copper extraction follows the sequence (see Figure below): 1.Beneficiation by froth flotation of ore to give copper concentrate
