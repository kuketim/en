## Ball Mill
The High Energy Ball Mill E max and MM 500 were developed for grinding with the highest energy input.The innovative design of both,the mills and the grinding jars,allows for continuous grinding down to the nano range in the shortest amount of time with only minor warming effects.These ball mills are also suitable for mechano chemistry.Optimization of mill performance by using16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;As the ball wear rate depends directly on the surface of the media charge,a small variation in power will lead to an important increase of wear rate.The risk of underloading or overloading the mill is an additional factor.A direct measurement of the ball level in the mill,more accurate than power readings,as well as a control of it,is
