## Ball mill
The ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials,and it is widely used in production lines for powders such as cement,silicates,refractory material,fertilizer,glass ceramics,etc.as well as for ore dressing of both ferrous and non ferrous metals.The ball mill can grind various ores and other materials either wet or dry.GRINDING MILLS BALL MILLS Page 4 New &amp; Used Mining.The ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials,and is widely used in production of powders such as cement,silicates,refractory material,and glass ceramics,as well as for ore dressing of both ferrous and non ferrous metals.Ball mills can grind wet or dry and can be continuous or batch type mills.
