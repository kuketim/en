## How to decrease particle size of alumina powder with ball.
Normally the amount of balls should be 55% of the apparent volume of the mill,as in a normal balls packing we have about 40% of empty space between them,this …Effect of ball size distribution on milling rate.The breakage rate parameters of a South African coal have been estimated.And the effect of ball size and ball size distribution is demonstrated.Eq.which gives an estimate of the overall value of breakage rate for a ball mixture in the mill accurately describes the ball size distribution effect especially in the normal breakage region.Added.

## Ball mill
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles andBall Mill LoadingBall Mill Loading Dry Milling.Ball Mill Loading (dry milling) When charging a ball mill,ceramic lined mill,pebble mill,jar mill or laboratory jar use on a jar rolling mill it is important to have the correct amount of media
