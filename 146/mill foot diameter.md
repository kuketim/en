## Calculator for Rolled Length of Roll of Material
Variations due to stretching or softness of the material are to be ignored.An example of rolled material would be a rolled carpet or a rolled sheet of paper from the paper mill.The length units that can be used are yard,feet,inch,meter,centimeter,millimeter,mil,and micron.A mil is equal to one thousandth of an inch.Hud Son Oscar 52 Slabber Sawmill Large Diameter BandmillThe Oscar 52 Sawmill has a huge 52″ log capacity and can cut up to a 48″ wide board,making it perfect for all those large logs that most other mills cannot begin to process.The wide throat enables you to cut slabs for tabletops,counter tops,mantles and much much more

## Circular Mil Foot
A circular mil foot (figure 1 3) is a unit of volume.It is a unit conductor 1 foot in length and has a cross sectional area of 1 circular mil.Because it is a unit conductor,the circular mil foot is useful in making comparisons between wires consisting of different metals.For example,a basis of comparison of the RESISTIVITY (to be discussed shortly) of variousOutwood WindmillThe whole is housed in a roundhouse of 22 feet (6.71 m) diameter with 9 feet (2.74 m) high walls.Body.The body of the mill measures 18 feet (5.49 m) by 11 feet (3.35 m) in plan,and the mill is 39 feet (11.89 m) tall to the roof.All the milling machinery is housed within the body.
