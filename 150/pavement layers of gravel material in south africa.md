## What is the construction cost for 1 km road?
The cost of construction of road typically depends on lot of factors.Here are the of main factors that drive the cost: 1.Type of Road : There are generally 2 types of pavements 1.Flexible pavement (Bituminous pavement) 2.Rigid Pavement (Concret.Typical Road Structure Cross SectionConsists of the naturally occurring material on which the road is built,or the imported fill material used to create an embankment on which the road pavement is constructed.Subgrades are also considered layers in the pavement design,with their thickness assumed to be infinite and their material characteristics assumed to be unchanged or unmodified.

South African pavement design had to be based on maintenance activities.If not,pavements would not last long.Pavement design was partly to blame for this problem.South African pavements were built on a design of using a low amount of waterproof layers.Road surfaceA road surface or pavement is the durable surface material laid down on an area intended to sustain vehicular or foot traffic,such as a road or walkway.In the past,gravel road surfaces,cobblestone and granite setts were extensively used,but these surfaces or.
