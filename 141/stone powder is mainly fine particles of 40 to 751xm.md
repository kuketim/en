## CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW
mineral powders for part of fine aggregate were mainly caused by the increase of the fine particles.Higher strength was achieved for concrete with mineral powder than that of concrete without substitution.There is a reduction in dynamic modulus ofMagnetiteMagnetite is a rock mineral and one of the main iron ores,with the chemical formula Fe 3 O 4.It is one of the oxides of iron,and is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself.It is the most magnetic of all the naturally occurring minerals on Earth.
