## Voltmeter
5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Working Principle of Voltmeter.Its Working is based on the principle of Ohm’s law.Ohm’s law states that “Voltage across a resistance is directly proportional to the current passing through it”.Any basic meter has a potential difference across its terminals when a full scale current flows through it.How does an electric iron works.Explain working of.25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;They work like an electric heater.They have a heating element made out of a metal alloy that gets hot when electricity is applied.Basically you apply a voltage to a the iron's heating element which induces a current.The current through the iron's heating element generates heat according to the formula Power = Current^2 * Resistance.

## Working Principle Analysis of Steam Electric Ironing Machine.
28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Steam electric ironing machine is safe and convenient to use,but because most of the instructions do not include circuit diagrams,once damaged,it will bring inconvenience to maintenance.Now there are many types and specifications of various electric ironing machines on the market,but the principle of circuit operation is basically the same.PHYSA simple electric motor is built so that a coil of wire connected to an electric circuit is free to rotate between two opposite magnetic poles.When electric current flows,AB section of the coil experiences downward force,and CD section of the coil experiences upward force.The wire starts to rotate counterclockwise.
