The phosphate adsorption on the tailings tended to decrease with an increase of pH.A phosphate desorbability of approximately 13 14% was observed,and this low desorbability likely resulted from a strong bonding between the adsorbed PO 4 3− and iron oxides in the tailings.Column flow through tests using both synthetic phosphate solution.TSUNAMI OF PHOSPHATE TAILINGS FROM ICL PLANT …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Phosphate Tailings Have a Higher Severity Profile Than Metals Floatation Tailings The ostensible goal of all slurry deposition of tailings is a dry stack within the impoundment that is stable,non permeable and without seepages.Metal slurries are 68% solid.
