## Cement and Sand ratio for brickwork How to Calculate,
With this simple formula,it is easy to estimate the amount of cement consumption required for brick masonry Remember depending on the class of brickwork of sand cement ratio the total calculation can change Additionally,a homogeneous mix of sand,cement,and water is the secret of the recipe for a stronger bond between bricks.Comparision of AAC Blocks vs CLC blocks vs Red Clay Bricks,This reduces the material consumption fo cement and also avoids curing process: Traditional mortar needs to be used and the brick work should be cured atleast for 7 days before plastering: Chemical mortars can be used for joining the brick This reduces the material consumption of cement and also avoids curing process

## Brick Calculator Find number of bricks in a wall,
Brick quantity estimation The calculations on this page is based on the following assumptions: i) The bricks are laid on stretcher bonds ii) There is 1 2 inch mortar joint between the bricks iii) The mortar mix is 1:4 (cement:sand) The simple way to calculate number of bricks is to divide surface area of the wall by the surface area (vertical face) of a single brickIS 3466 (B) (1988): SPECIFICATION FOR MASONRY CEMENT1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Masonry cement is chiefly intended for use in masonry mortars for brick,stone and concrete block masonry,and for rendering and plastering work.Because of its property of producing a smooth,plastic,cohesive and strong,yet workable,mortar when mixed with fine aggregates,masonry cement is.
