## Depth and thickness conversion
A mil is a measurement that equals one thousandth of an inch,or 0.001 inch.One mil also equals 0.0254 mm (millimeter).Thus a mil is not the same thickness as a millimeter.The term &quot;mil&quot; is not an abbreviation but a unit of measure.The chart below gives you an idea of mils to millimeters to inches.Thickness measurements with Spectrometer from ZEISSThe layer thickness is calculated from the periodicity of the interference spectrum.This method is insensitive to noise and suitable for thick layers,however,requires a large computational effort and is less accurate.It is suitable for single and multi layer systems from 200 &#181;m.

## Understanding and Measuring Decarburization
the free ferrite layer’s maximum depth (often variable) plus the depth of partial decarburization to the unaffected core is measured.This total—FFD + PDD—is called maximum affected depth (MAD).These depths are not uniform and can vary substantially,leading to measure ments of average FFD,PDD,and MAD,as well as maximum values for each.Boundary layer thickness&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;For general flows you have to find the boundary layer edge by applying an appropriate criterion,e.g.reaching 99% of the velocity of the free stream.However,the boundary layer thickness as a representative value can be quite inaccurate because of the small velocity gradients at the boundary layer edge.
