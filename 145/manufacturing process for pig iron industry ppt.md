## How iron is made
Iron ore is converted into various types of iron through several processes.The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to produce pig iron which is about 94% iron and 5% carbon with smaller amounts of other elements.Technical measures of air pollution control in the iron.23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Pouring and pig iron casting (dust,gases,metal vapours) Desulphurization,alkali vapours) Slag granulation (dust,gases) Cement works (dust,gases) Demolition and lining of blast furnaces,air heaters,etc.(dust,free S1O2) Flue gas stack (dust,gases) Fig.2 Sources of air pollution in the iron and steel industry a) Pig iron production 10

## Pig iron
Pig iron is an intermediate product of the iron industry,also known as crude iron,which is obtained by smelting iron ore in a blast furnace.Pig iron has a very high carbon content,typically 3.8 4.7%,along with silica and other constituents of dross,which makes it very brittle and not useful directly as a material except for limited applications.Iron &amp; Steel Industry in India: Production,Market Size.India was the world’s second largest steel producer@ with production standing at 106.5 MT in 2018.The growth in the Indian steel sector has been driven by domestic availability of raw materials such as iron ore and cost effective labour.Consequently,the steel sector has been a major contributor to India’s manufacturing output.

## FOUNDRY PIG IRON
3 4 Kobe Steel manufactures foundry pig iron of high quality by dephosphorizing and desulfurization of the hot pig iron.Our foundry pig iron are used widely for a various fields of castings in the manufacturing industry.Central coke charging equipment Above burdenSteel ProductionThe first blast furnaces appeared in the 14th century and produced one ton per day.Even though equipment is improved and higher production rates can be achieved,the processes inside the blast furnace remain the same.The blast furnace uses coke,iron ore and limestone to produce pig iron.Coal is a key part of the coke making process.
