## How stainless steel is made
Stainless steel can also be cut using flame cutting,which involves a flame fired torch using oxygen and propane in conjunction with iron powder.This method is clean and fast.Another cutting method is known as plasma jet cutting,in which an ionized gas column in conjunction with an electric arc through a small orifice makes the cut.How hydrogen could change the face of steel …The production of pig iron,which is later made into crude steel,uses iron ore as a basic material together with what is referred to as a reducing agent,which removes oxygen from the iron ore.Traditional pig iron manufacturing processes usually use coke as a reducing agent.
