## Improved Relationships for Discharge in SAG AG Mills
Comminution is an essential component of mineral processing operations and its proper operation and design is vital to ensure that the plant operates efficiently.In recent years,there has been a shift of emphasis on ball mill optimization to semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mills.The Advantages and Disadvantages of Powder Grinding.The Disadvantages of Ball Mill: 1.Low working efficiency and high unit electricity consumption.2.Heavy equipment.Large sized ball mill weighs several hundred of tons so that the one time investment is high.3.Low rotary speed.4.High consumption of grinding media and lining board.5.Loud noise and strong vibration during its working process.
