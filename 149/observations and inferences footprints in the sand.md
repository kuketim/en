## Understanding Erosion,Deposition,and Burial
You started by making observations and inferences about what this first set of footprints meant.Once you had more evidence,you were able to make more observations,more inferences,and put together a more complete story.Even if we didn’t all agree,you.Dr.STEM Mom: May 2012Inferences are how we interpret our observations.During discussion I give statements and have students guess if it is an observation or an inference.Then they are ready to study the graphic below.It shows 2 sets of footprints and they are to list ONLY
