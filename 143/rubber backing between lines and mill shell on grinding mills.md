Roller Mills Grinding Mills Williams Crusher Roller mills are industrial mills that,instead of using flat plates,uses cylindrical rollers to crush and grind material.The Williams Roller Mills are designed to provide years of reliable,consistent,and efficient operation,but the reason why Williams is one of the leading roller mill manufacturers is their ease of use and maintenance.Rod MillsRod Mills may be considered either fine crushers or coarse grinding equipment.They are capable of taking as large as 2″ feed and making a product as fine as 48 mesh.Of particular advantage is their adaptability to handling wet sticky ores,which normally would.

## Rod Mills
4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Head and shell liners for Steel Head Rod Mills are available in Decolloy (a chrome nickel alloy),hard iron,electric steel,molychrome steel,and manganese steel.Rod Mills use low cost grinding media.Without this rubber or wood backing,the life of the mill is drastically reduced due to metal fatigue and simply being worn away.Practical Roll TechniquesThe correct way to measure concentricity on a grinding machine is 180&#186; from wheel (back side),if the roll.For example,if the grinding seat is out of round this form will be transferred to the roll shell by the grinding wheel.Run out will not be seen on the wheel side but when a.done at the mill or at an outside roll shop.
