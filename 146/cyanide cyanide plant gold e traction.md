## The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching An Introduction.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Leaching gold with a cyanide solution remains the most widely used hydrometallurgical process for the extraction of gold from ores and concentrates.Despite the difficulties and hazards of working with cyanide,no other process has yet been proven to be an economic viable alternative.cyanide gold extraction processGold is in high demand for products ranging from jewelry to electronics and medical devices.To extract gold from ore,mining companies typically use the sodium cyanide process,in which the gold is converted into a watersoluble coordination complex and activated carbon is used to leach the gold …

## cyanide Archives
Cyanide regulations around the world are advancing and target not only residual cyanide contained in wastewater and tailings produced by mining and metallurgical operations but also place strict limits for cyanidation and cyanide destruction by products such as ammonia,cyanate,thiocyanate and nitrite,according to BQE.SART Mining SGSCyanide recovery has a significant impact on the economics of processing high cyanide consuming copper gold orebodies since less cyanide is required overall in the plant.When cyanide is destroyed in a gold recovery operation,the costs and hazards associated with the purchase,delivery and destruction of the reagent represents a substantial.
