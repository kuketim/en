general classification and mineralogy Because of their detrital nature,any mineral can occur in a sedimentary rock.Clay minerals,the dominant mineral produced by chemical weathering of rocks,is the most abundant mineral in mudrocks.Quartz,because it is stable under conditions present at the surface of the Earth,and because it is also a product of chemical weathering,is the most.
