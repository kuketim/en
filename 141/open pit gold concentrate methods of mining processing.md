## Placer Mining Methods
There are four main mining methods: underground,open surface (pit),placer,and in situ mining.Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels,beach sands,or other environments.In situ mining.Gold Mining from Open Pit Extraction to Heap Leaching&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Gold Mining from Open Pit Extraction to Heap Leaching Educational 3D Animated Video For more information and to request a FREE estimate,contact us today.
