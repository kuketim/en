## Tinplate
Early (hot rolling) strip mills did not produce strip suitable for tinplate,but in 1929 cold rolling began to be used to reduce the gauge further.The first strip mill in Great Britain was opened at Ebbw Vale in 1938 with an annual output of 200,000 tons.The strip mill had several advanIron Forge in Colonial America by Harry Schenawolf.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The rolling mill and slitting mill,unlike the forge and blast furnace which were chemical and metallurgical engineered,these represented mechanical technology.It is believed that in the 1580s,the use of gears (similar to what might be seen in grist mills or saw mills) was applied to rolling mills for the purposes of flattening iron.
