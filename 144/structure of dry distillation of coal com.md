## Numerical Simulation of the Tar Mist and Dust …
In the low temperature dry distillation of low rank coal,the important liquid product of coal tar is produced,but its quality and utilization rate are degraded by entrained dust.The movement of coal tar and dust in the furnace is a key factor in causing particles such as dust to mix with coal tar.Therefore,the Euler Lagrangian method is used to simulate the two phase motion process of.Biochar Carbons Finland LtdBiochar is a new but also an old thing.Biochar is produced by low oxygen pyrolysis,or dry distillation.Thanks to this method,the natural porous structure of the raw material remains in biochar.Fossil carbon,such as coal extracted from the earth,can be considered the opposite of biochar.

## Dry distillation
Dry distillation is the heating of solid materials to produce gaseous products (which may condense into liquids or solids).The method may involve pyrolysis or thermolysis,or it may not (for instance,a simple mixture of ice and glass could be separated without breaking any chemical bonds,but organic matter contains a greater diversity of molecules,some of which are likely to break).Numerical Simulation of the Tar Mist and Dust Movement …Coal accounts for approximately 72% of the country's total energy consumption,and China's coal based energy structure is expected to remain stable for a long time [4].China's northern Shaanxi region is rich in coal resources,with proven reserves of 146 billion tons.

## Coal
COAL Of all known fuels,coal (q.v.) is by far the most important.In spite of developments in the use of oil and water power it still provides three quarters of the world's total energy supplies.Further,the reserves of coal,which according to recent estimates may be expected to last some 1,000 years at the present rate of consumption,are far above those of any other combustible.Dry distillation of Yulin coal 《Clean Coal Technology》2013年04期First crush the Yulin raw coal,then analyse the influence of heating temperature and method,segmentation methods,raw coal particle size on dry distillation.Determine the suitable condition of carbonization process for Yulin coal.The results show that Yulin coal has higher strength,which help to improve utilization rate.

## Destructive distillation
Destructive distillation is a chemical process in which decomposition of unprocessed material is achieved by heating it to a high temperature; the term generally applies to processing of organic material in the absence of air or in the presence of limited amounts of oxygen or other reagents,catalysts,or solvents,such as steam or phenols.Snakes,sausages and structural formulae Feature Chemistry World9 Oct 2015.16th century European apothecaries dry distilled it to obtain benzoic acid (still used today to treat skin diseases).Early 19th century chemists identified other members of a &#39;benzoyl&#39; family and in 1825,at London&#39;s Royal Institution,Michael Faraday isolated a substance he called &#39;bicarburet of hydrogen&#39;,&nbsp;.
