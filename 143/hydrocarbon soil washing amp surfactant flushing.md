## Removing of hydrocarbon contaminated soil via air flushing.
Abstract.Surfactants enhanced air sparging actually acts to displace the organic contaminant entrapped in soil pores.In this work,a comparison study was carried out between two air flushing modes,namely,continuous air flushing and pulsed air flushing,which was conducted to remediate soil contaminated with waste lubricant oil.
