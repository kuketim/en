## Bond Index Ball Mill Rod Mill BT 100 XL …
The Bond Index Ball Mill Rod Mill BT 100 XL is used in the planning of crushing plants.The optimum number of grinding balls is 285.At least 15 to 20 kg sample material is required to simulate a closed grinding circuit in a ball or rod mill.Upwards for loading,horizontal for grinding,downwards for discharging.The kinetics and efficiency of batch ball grinding with.Grinding balls were selected as shown in Table 1 for these reasons: firstly,it was observed that only balls smaller than 40 mm may show significant effects of media on grinding kinetics in small laboratory mills (20 cm diameters or smaller); secondly,to mimic the charge motion in industrial mill,the ratio of mill cylinder’s diameter to maximum ball size should be at least 6,for instance.
