## Ball Mill Design Power Calculation
2020 2 28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The basic parameters used in ball mill design (power calculations),rod mill or any tumbling mill sizing are; material to be ground,characteristics,Bond Work Index,bulk density,specific density,desired mill tonnage capacity DTPH,operating % solids or pulp density,feed size as F80 and maximum ‘chunk size’,product size as P80 and maximum and finally the type of circuit open closed.Milling Our Equipment British RemaThe controlled reduction of a material’s particle size by milling,grinding or micronising to achieve the required end product is a vital commercial process.Whether particle size reduction is required as an economical means of improving solubility,to increase dissolution rates or to improve batch to batch consistency and performance,British Rema can offer a solution.

## Ball Mill an overview ScienceDirect Topics
In general,ball mills can be operated either wet or dry and are capable of producing products in the order of 100 μm.This represents reduction ratios of as great as 100.Very large tonnages can be ground with these ball mills because they are very effective material handling devices.Ball mills are rated by power rather than capacity.Cocoa LiquorThe pre ground cocoa liquor from 1st grinding step is fine ground in a subsequent agitated ball mill.Required end fineness is 99,5 99,9% &lt; 75 &#181;m.In case of using the cocoa liquor for the production of dark chocolates with a high cocoa content,the required fineness is d90 = 18 &#181;m.
