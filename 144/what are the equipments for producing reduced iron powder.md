## Iron powder
Iron powder has several uses; for example production of magnetic alloys and certain types of steels.[1] Iron powder is formed as a whole from several other iron particles.The particle sizes vary anywhere from 200 μm.The iron properties differ depending on the production method and history of a specific iron powder.There are three types.Control of Pollution in the Iron and Steel IndustryThe iron and steel industry causes significant effects on environmental media air,water and soil.In the sinter plants the dominant emissions generated from material handling,windbox exhaust,disharge end,and cold screen are particulate emissions.

## Metal Powder
Metal powders must exhibit consistent powder characteristics in ensuring repeatable manufacture of metal parts (Slotwinski et al.2014).For instance,metal powders use in additive manufacturing are assumed to be nominally spherical,and have a particle size distribution that is designed to facilitate good packing behavior,such that the final manufactured part has good mechanical properties.
