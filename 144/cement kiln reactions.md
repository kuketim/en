## Modeling of Rotary Cement Kilns: Applications to Reduction.
Rotary cement kilns are used for converting calcineous raw meal into cement clinkers.In this paper,we discuss and evaluate possible ways of reducing energy.(PDF) Reactions of alkalis,chlorine and sulfur during …Cl behavior in a cement kiln has been examined by the application of WDF with high [Cl] and by the addition of Cl in raw meal,since Cl is introduced to the kiln through the raw materials and fuel.
