Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low grade ore by converting the gold to a water soluble coordination complex It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extractionUS3777003Athe present invention relates to a method for leaching a mineral from an ore containing said mineral wherein a leaching solution is passed upwardly through a downwardly flowing bed or ore.the leaching solution is passed through the ore under conditions of quiescent flow whereby the mineral is dissolved from the mineral ore and is withdrawn from the upper portion of a vessel containing said.The Iwato ore is gold and silver bearing silicified porous rock.As most gold and silver in the Iwato ore are concentrated in the pores,leaching of coarse sized ore is expected to be possible.Laboratory tests and pilot plant tests of vat leaching for the Iwato ore were carried out using 0.8.0 mm feed.

## Heap leaching a stack of gold MiningFeeds
In the case of gold recovery,heap leaching generally requires 60 to 90 days to leach the ore,compared to the 24 hours required by a conventional agitated leach process Gold recovery is also usually only 70% compared with 90% recovery in an agitated leach plant,and vat leaching,especially where low grade ores and tailings are present.Agglomeration Heap Leaching Operations in the Precious,COLORADO GOLD VAT LEACHING,1,500 TPD In this operation,the agglomerated feed is leached in large vats rather than in heaps The operation is located in the Colorado Rocky Mountains southwest of Denver at an elevation of 10,000 ft (5) The gold ore occurs in an oxidized dis seminated deposit and averages 006 tr oz.

## Gold Cyanidation Ground Truth Trekking
Cyanide "vat leaching" mixes finely crushed ore with a cyanide salt in water The cyanide binds to the gold ions,and makes them soluble in water,thereby allowing separation from the rock This process usually takes place inside a mill or other mining facilityGold Vat Leaching TechnologyWhen it comes to gold extraction,CRONIMET Mining Processing has undertaken a significant amount of work.In fact,our team has spearheaded the development of a unique vat leaching process,aimed at improving upon the conventional heap and tank leaching processes.5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;One example of a leaching process that uses vat leaching is gold cyanidation,the process of extracting gold from low grade ores.In this process,a dilute solution of sodium cyanide (NaCN) is used to leach the Au into solution.The concentration is usually 0.0.05 % cyanide,or 500ppm.
