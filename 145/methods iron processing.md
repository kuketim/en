## Cast Iron: Properties,Processing and Applications
Cast iron is an iron alloy containing 2 wt.% 4 wt.% carbon,1 wt.% 3 wt.% silicon and smaller amounts of minor elements [1].In comparison,steel has a lower carbon content of up to 2 wt.% and a lower silicon content.Cast iron can also be further optimized by alloying with small quantities of manganese,molybdenum,cerium,nickel,copper,vanadium and titanium before being cast.Forging Methods Metal Casting Resources18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Forging methods.There are several forging methods with different capabilities and benefits.The more commonly used forging methods include the drop forging methods,as well as roll forging.Drop forging.Drop forging derives its name from the process of dropping a hammer onto the metal to mold it into the shape of the die.
