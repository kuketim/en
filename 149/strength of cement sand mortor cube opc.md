## Cement
Cement in concrete and mortar creates its strength by chemical reaction,it is not like wallpaper glue which 'drys out',it 'goes off'.In fact,if the concrete or mortar should 'dry out' before the chemical reaction is substantially complete,it will fail.Mix the lime with the sand before adding the cement.Sand: Two types of sand are.Mortar Mixes1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mortar Mixes Here are seven common and uncommon mortar mixes.They are types N,M,S and O.There is also mortar for glass block,straight lime mortar and type K.Type K is used solely in historic preservation.Each one has a certain proportion of Portland cement,hydrated lime and sand.Mortar proportions are always expressed in that order.

## Strength of Cement
Back to Main Page.Strength of Cement Strength of cement is the most important of all the cement properties.Grades mentioned in the cement bags as 53 43 grade OPC PPC in fact represent the strength of the cement.53 Grade OPC Cement simply means that days compressive strength of the cement mortar cubes prepared out of that cement in a standard manner will be of 53 MPa.List of IS Codes for Cement and ConcreteHere are the IS codes which cater to the need of civil engineering relating to Cement and Concrete.These IS codes include the Standardization in the field of all types of cement,pozzolana,testing sand,concrete,aggregates,instruments for cement and concrete testing,cement plant machinery and ferrocement concrete,reinforced concrete and pre stressed concrete,test methods for concrete.
