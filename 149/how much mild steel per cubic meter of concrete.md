## For one meter cube of concrete how much kg steel is.
its depend on dia of bar used in concrete for example the weight of steel of one meter rod having six mm dia is two hundrerd and twenty grams and ten mm dia is six hundrerd and twenty grams etc you can find weight of different bars having different diameters by this formula = (d*d) one hundrerd sixty twohow much does 1 cubic meter of average steel weight …20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A cubic meter has 100 cm's per side,so it contains 100 X 100 X 100 = 1 million cc's.1 million cc's of water weighs 1 million grams = 1000 kg.Steel has a density of about 7.8,so a cubic meter of steel would weigh about 7800 kg.
