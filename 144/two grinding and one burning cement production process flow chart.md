## Raw Material Drying Grinding
Closed circuit ball mill with two compartments for coarse and fine grinding and a drying compartment with lifters are generally found in cement plants for raw material grinding.Compartments (filled with grinding media) are divided by a double diaphragm with flow control to utilize maximum mill length for effective grinding.Cement mill notebookIn cement grinding the mill ventilation system fulfils two important functions,cooling the cement and removing the heat generated during the grinding process,and carrying part of the finished product out of the grinding area.It is well known that the energy used during the grinding process in ball mills is almost entirely converted into heat.
