## Underground mining (hard rock)
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Underground hard rock mining refers to various underground mining techniques used to excavate hard minerals,usually those containing metals such as ore containing gold,silver,iron,copper,zinc,nickel,tin and lead,but also involves using the same techniques for excavating ores of gems such as diamonds or rubies.Mining BritannicaLarge stripping machines with excavating wheels used in surface coal mining are employed in other types of open pit mines.Water inflow was a very important problem in underground mining until James Watt invented the steam engine in the 18th century.After that,steam driven pumps could be used to remove water from the deep mines of the day.
