## Cadmium
Cadmium is a chemical element with the symbol Cd and atomic number 48.This soft,silvery white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in group 12,zinc and mercury.Like zinc,it demonstrates oxidation state +2 in most of its compounds,and like mercury,it has a lower melting point than the transition metals in groups 3 through 11.WO2012040829A1 Selective leach recovery of zinc from a.Zinc and lead are usually concomitantly present in Zn Pb ores and tailings.A novel non polluting hydrometallurgical process for selectively leaching and recovering zinc (Zn) from a composite lead (Pb) and zinc sulphide containing mineral,crashed untreated rock or unconsolidate mineral particles,mill tailings and or agglomerated or unagglomerated sulphidic zinc containing waste material.

## Zinc production & environmental impact GreenSpec
Zinc production & environmental impact.Key points.Some mines produce zinc as a side product of some metal that has a higher concentration in the ore.Most zinc mines produce zinc and lead or zinc and nickel.• The production for sulfidic zinc ores produces large amounts of sulfur dioxide (can form acid rain) and cadmium vapour.
