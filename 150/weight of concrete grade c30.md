## Concrete grades based on different international codes
The concrete grades are normally indicated as M30 or C30 or C30 37 and so on depending on the code.The alphabet ‘M’ or ‘c” refers to it as a ‘Concrete Mix’ and the number that follows indicates the characteristic strength of that that mix in MPa at 28 days.Properties of concreteConcrete has relatively high compressive strength (it doesn't crack under weight),but significantly lower tensile strength (it cracks when being pulled).The compressive strength is typically controlled with the ratio of water to cement when forming the concrete,and.

What is Grade of Concrete? Grade of concrete is defined as the minimum strength the concrete must posses after 28 days of construction with proper quality control.Grade of concrete is denoted by prefixing M to the desired strength in MPa.For example,for a.Mix Design For M35 Grade Of ConcreteThe mix design for M35 Grade Of Concrete for pile foundations provided here is for reference purpose only.Actual site conditions vary and thus this should be adjusted as per the location and other factors.Grade of Concrete : M35 Characteristic Strength (Fck) : 35
