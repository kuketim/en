## What is dry process in cement manufacturing?
In dry process for manufacturing of cement,the raw materials are dried and reduced in size to a fine powder in to grinding mill.The dry powder is called the raw meal.The raw meal is pumped into a blending silo.The raw meal is blended by passin.Cement Manufacturing Process: What is Cement made of.Cement manufacturing process &amp; what is cement made of,it can be discussed conveniently under two headings: Selection of Raw materials and manufacturing methods.Raw Materials of Cement.Most important raw materials (what is cement made of) required in the manufacture of Portland Cement are: Limestone,Clay,Gypsum,Fuel,and Water (in wet method).
