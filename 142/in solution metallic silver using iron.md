## Metal ions in aqueous solution
A metal ion in aqueous solution or aqua ion is a cation,dissolved in water,of chemical formula [M(H2O)n]z+.The solvation number,n,determined by a variety of experimental methods is 4 for Li+ and Be2+ and 6 for elements in periods 3 and 4 of the periodic table.Lanthanide and actinide aqua ions have a solvation number of 8 or 9.The.Qualitative tests on 3d metal ions (Cr,Mn,Fe,Co,Ni,Cu,…Attention: the Fe 3+ ions need to be masked by NaF while Cu 2+ ions require some sodium thiosulfate to mask them.Ni.A very selective reaction for Ni(II) determination is known for almost 100 years.It includes the formation of the complex compound: Ni 2+: To several drops of unknown,add some tartric acid,dimethylglyoxime solution,and then slowly add aqueous ammonia.
