## Mill (grinding)
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.Gypsum Raymond MillGypsum Powder raymond mill Features : 1.Low production cost,high performance Overall for the vertical structure,small footprint,systematic,from raw material delivered to the milling and roughing to final packaging,of an independent production system 2.Good
