4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The drive of the ball mill consists of an induction electric motor,two stage gearbox and the pinion gear.This pinion gear is mated with the girth gear mounted on circumference of the ball mill shell and in that way it transfers the motion from the drive to the shell,see Figure 1,taken from [1].Figure 1.Mechanical system of a ball mill.Split cylindrical roller bearings SKFSplit cylindrical roller bearings are intended primarily for bearing arrangements which are difficult to access or for cranked shafts.It is advantageous to use them in all cases where the maintenance or replacement of non split bearings would require considerable extra time consuming effort and would cause long and expensive or even inadmissible machine downtime.
