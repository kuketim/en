## Compressive Strength of Concrete Cubes
Cube Testing Machine is meant for testing the concrete cube which is part of a simple yet cost effective test process that allows in judging compressive strength of concrete as well as for quality assurance to ensure concrete is fit for defined purposes in line with defined industry standards.Modulus of Rupture of Concrete Beam6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Modulus of rupture is a measure of the tensile strength of concrete beams or slabs.Flexural strength identifies the amount of stress and force an unreinforced concrete slab,beam or other structure can withstand such that it resists any bending failures.Modulus of rupture is also known as flexural strength,bend strength or fracture strength.
