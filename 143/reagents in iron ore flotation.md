Thus,the development of the techniques for a selective separation and rejection of typical associated minerals in the iron oxide ores,such as phosphorous minerals (mainly apatite group),is a high priority.Reverse anionic flotation by using sodium silicate (SS) as an iron oxide depressant is one of the techniques for iron ore processing.Reagents in iron ores flotation,Minerals Engineering …The role of reagents utilised in iron ores flotation is reviewed.Desliming and flotation stages should be performed at pH levels as low as possible to reduce the expenses with caustic soda.Ether amines are by far the mostly utilised class of collector.The degree of neutralisation of the ether amine is an important process parameter.The partial substitution of amine by non polar oils seems.

## Investigation of Adsorption Mechanism of Reagents …
A classification of reagents for iron ore flotation and their adsorption mechanism have been summarized.• There is a strong relationship between reagents used and surface properties as well as mineralogy of ore for an efficient flotation.• The reagents to be chosen.Treatment and Recycling of the Process Water in Iron …In order to ensure iron concentrate grade and iron recovery,a large number of processing reagents are selected and applied in the iron ore beneficiation.The process water carried plenty of residual processing reagents,and such wastewater with color depth and strong smell could seriously affect the environment and the local people.

## Beneficiation of Iron Ore
SILICA FLOTATION REAGENTS A cationic reagent is usually all that is necessary to effectively activate and float the silica from the iron.Since no prior reagents have come in contact with the thoroughly washed and relatively slime free magnetic iron concentrates,the cationic reagent is fast acting and in some cases no prior conditioning ahead of the flotation cells is necessary.Flotation Reagents for Miningto quickly screen new reagents by applying these to a client’s ores,obtaining a fast turnaround of results and refining our products accordingly.About Our Labs Our mineral processing lab in Melbourne,Australia,opened in 2014 and is fully equipped for mineral sample preparation,flotation and basic analytical needs.Staffed

## 1 Introduction
flotation routes developed for iron ores,currently,the reverse cationic flotation route developed by the USBM branch in Minnesota is by far the most widely used flotation route in the iron ore industry.The two anionic flotation routes developed by Hanna Mining and Cyanamid,i.e.direct anionic flotation and reverse anionic flotation routes.
