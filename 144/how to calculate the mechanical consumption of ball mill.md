## Calculate and Select Ball Mill Ball Size for Optimum Grinding
In Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do.Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize “just in case”.Well,this saThe Cement Plant Operations Handbook30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Cement Plant Operations Handbook Seventh Edition 6.Cement milling Finish milling is the grinding together of clinker with some 5 per cent gypsum,natural or synthetic,for set control,and quite often other components: blastfurnace slag,pozzolan,silica fume,limestone or pulverised fuel ash (‘pfa’ also known as ‘fly ash’).

## Ball mill
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.Ball Mill Design Power Calculation&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Ball Mill Power Calculation Example A wet grinding ball mill in closed circuit is to be fed 100 TPH of a material with a work index of 15 and a size …
