## Cement Production
Cement production is responsible for around 7% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.The only larger contributors are electricity generation and transport.Most of the CO 2 released when cement is made comes from the chemical reaction.The limestone from which it is made is calcium carbonate,and when this is heated it gives off carbon dioxide.MANUFACTURING OF CEMENTManufacture of Cement To manufacture cement first of all limestone is added into the clay in proportion of 3:1 by weight.This mixture of limestone and clay is then dried and crushed to get a fine powder called ‘raw meal’.The raw meal is then added into a rotary kiln through a hopper as shown in figure.

Main chemical compounds of Portland cement with their chemical formula &amp; their percentages by weight are as follows.Of the all,the silicates C 3 S and C 2 S are the most important compounds,which are responsible for the strength of hydrated cement paste.The presence of C 3 A in cement isCorrosion of Basic Refractories in Contact with Cement.2014 10 28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;meal and clinker came from the cement rotary kiln working with precalciner system and using alternative fuels.The corrosion test was carried out in the temperature range from 1200˚C to 1450˚C,corresponding to the tem peratures of the shifting furnace charge in the segment of the sintering zone of cement rotary kiln,considering
