## Respirable Crystalline Silica from Sand Mining Wisconsin.
Sand mining operations designed to mine and export ‘frac sand’ are often much larger in acreage than the smaller,more traditional Wisconsin sand mines that serve mainly local needs for sand.The sand is desirable for fracing and some other uses due to its size,shape,and crystalline silica properties and because the deposits are usually.Residents near silica sand mines in Wisconsin and Iowa.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Dangers of silica sand mines still largely unknown.public health researchers disagree on the impact the dust has on the long term health of residents living in and near silica sand mining.

## What is Silica Sand?
Silica sand deposits are most commonly surface mined in open pit operations,but dredging and underground mining are also employed.Extracted ore undergoes considerable processing to increase the silica content by reducing impurities.It is then dried and sized to produce the optimum particle size distribution for the intended application.Silica SandSilica sand mines producing frac sand may or may not process the sand on site.Off site processing plants that receive silica sand from various mining operations in Minnesota and Wisconsin are also found in Minnesota.How is it mined? In Minnesota,all silica sand mines that produce industrial and agricultural sand operate as surface quarries.

## Background
About silica (frac) sand mining and processing in Minnesota &quot;Frac sand&quot; is characterized by consistently round and extremely hard grains of pure silica sand.It is used in hydraulic fracturing,or &quot;fracking,&quot; which is a technology to pressurize,fracture,and prop open deep oil and gas shale fields to release petroleum.Why it's importantSilica Statistics and InformationIn almost all cases,silica mining uses open pit or dredging mining methods with standard mining equipment.Except for temporarily disturbing the immediate area while mining operations are active,sand and gravel mining usually has limited environmental impact.

## Silica Minerals Education Coalition
Silica.Also called silica sand or quartz sand,silica is silicon dioxide (SiO 2).Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth’s crust.Since sand is plentiful,easy to mine and relatively easy to process,it is the primary ore source of silicon.The metamorphic rock,quartzite,is another source.Australian Resources Silica Sand MiningLinkAustralia has been a user of silica sand ever since white settlement,with one of its major silica sand mines being created in the 1930's on the Kurnell Peninsula near Sydney,where Captain Cook had earlier landed.There were more than 70 million tonnes of silica sand removed from this mining operation before it was closed in 1990.
