## Iron Ore Smelting Process
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;There are two distinct categories of iron ore mining,surface mining such as open cast or strip mining and underground mining.At the surface iron ore processing plants,the iron ore is put through crushers and ball mills to break it into a uniform and more workable size and then washed with the residue going to tailings.The Extraction of IronCast iron has already been mentioned above.This section deals with the types of iron and steel which are produced as a result of the steel making process.Wrought iron: If all the carbon is removed from the iron to give high purity iron,it is known as wrought iron.Wrought iron is quite soft and easily worked and has little structural strength.

## Iron processing
7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Iron processing Iron processing Iron making: The primary objective of iron making is to release iron from chemical combination with oxygen,and,since the blast furnace is much the most efficient process,it receives the most attention here.Alternative methods known as direct reduction are used in over a score of countries,but less than 5 percent of iron is made this way.Iron processing Britannica2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Iron processing,use of a smelting process to turn the ore into a form from which products can be fashioned.Included in this article also is a discussion of the mining of iron and of its preparation for smelting.Iron (Fe) is a relatively dense metal with a silvery white appearance and distinctive

## Processing
An important precondition for LKAB's cost effectiveness is our raw material,magnetite ore,as well as the energy efficient pelletizing process.The processing of the iron ore commences once the ore has been transported to the sorting plant from the underground and surface mines.Evaluation on Deep Reduction of Iron Ore Based on Digital.The deep reduction of iron oxides and the growth of iron particles were conducted during reduction for refractory iron ore.Currently,metallization rate as an evaluation index of reduction can only evaluate reductive degree,but not particle size characteristics of iron.

## Metal Profile: Iron Properties and Characteristics
Iron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron containing ores.﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore,leaving behind a soft,malleable iron metal.Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present day Iraq) between 27 BCE.
