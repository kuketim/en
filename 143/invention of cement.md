## The history and importance of concrete
The cement used mostly in today's concrete is called portland cement.The process to produce portland cement was invented by Joseph Aspdin in the early 1800's in England.The name portland may have been originally a marketing ploy,as portland building stone was very popular in England at that time [ 1 ],and Aspdin may have wanted people to favorably compare concrete made with his cement to.ConcreteConcrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time.In the past limebased cement binders were often used,such as lime putty,but sometimes with other hydraulic cements,such as a calcium aluminate cement or with Portland cement to form Portland cement concrete (for its visual resemblance to.

## Mixer History
The mixer is similar,though larger in scale,than the smaller ones found on construction sites.A large motor,separate from the engine,rotates the drum on the truck body,and a series of blades or a screw powered by the same motor keeps the aggregate,water and cement in constant motion.This keeps the premixed concrete from setting,though.Mixer HistoryAs technology has changed,so has the basic mixer design.While many transit mixers still have rotating drums,most don't simply pick up a load of wet cement and transport it.The few that still do head mostly to road sites where it's possible to pour the mixture
