## Electrorefining of Copper
21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Electrorefining of Copper 1.Electrorefining General Introduction In an electrorefining process,the anode is the impure metal and the impurities must be lost during the passage of the metal from the anode to the cathode during electrolysis,i.e.the electrode reactions are,at the anode: M → Mn+ + ne and at the cathode: Mn+ + ne → MFrom Ore to Finished Product1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Copper From Beginning to End.Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man.It is found in ore deposits around the world.It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago.And as alloyed in bronze (copper tin alloy) about 3000 BC,was the first engineering material known to man.

Open pit: 90% of ore is mined by this method.Ores near the surface can be quarried after removal of the surface layers.The ore is treated with dilute sulfuric acid.This trickles slowly through the ore dissolving copper to form copper sulfate.The copper is recovered by electrolytic refining.Advantages of this process are: See for further.copper extraction and purification26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Purification of copper.When copper is made from sulphide ores by the first method above,it is impure.The blister copper is first treated to remove any remaining sulphur (trapped as bubbles of sulphur dioxide in the copper hence &quot;blister copper&quot;) and then cast into anodes for refining using electrolysis.Electrolytic refining
