## Ore
6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals,typically metals,that can be mined,treated and sold at a profit.Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined,often via smelting,to extract the valuable metals or minerals.The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.What is Lithium Extraction and How Does It Work?By definition,lithium extraction is a set of chemical processes where lithium is isolated from a sample and converted to a saleable form of lithium,generally a stable yet readily convertible compound such as lithium carbonate.Most lithium extraction processes entail some form of mining to reach underground deposits of lithium rich minerals.
