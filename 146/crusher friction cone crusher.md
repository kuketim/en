## What Is A Cone Crusher,How Does A Cone Crusher Work
What Is A Cone Crusher.A Cone Crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel.It is normally used in secondary,tertiary,and quaternary crushing stagesJaw Crusher MaterialsThe masher is a crusher consisting of moving jaws and static rafts.It is used to simulate the movement of animals and complete the crushing of materials.When the jaw crusher is working,the jaws wear first.As the material enters the crushing chamber,the moving jaws are squeezed to form a strongly compressed state,and the fixed jaws are subject to intense cutting by material friction.

The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher.The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended,as in the gyratory,but is supported in a curved,universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2).Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a V belt or direct drive.Aggregate and MiningCrusher backing is used to fill open cavities behind the wear parts and support or “backup” the wear surfaces in the crusher,protecting the machinery from friction,vibration,and impact during crushing operations.
