## 16.6A: Microbial Ore Leaching
ore leaching: The process of recovering metals from ores by using a number of different techniques.Microbial ore leaching (bioleaching) is the process of extracting metals from ores with the use of microorganisms.This method is used to recover many different precious metals like copper,lead,zinc,gold,silver,and nickel.2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Bioleaching is the extraction of metals from their ores through the use of living organisms.This is much cleaner than the traditional heap leaching using cyanide.Bioleaching is one of several applications within biohydrometallurgy and several methods are used to recover copper,zinc,lead,arsenic,antimony,nickel,molybdenum,gold,silver,and cobaltHeap Leach: Mining's breakthrough technology MINING.comNew techniques for tailings treatment and sulfide ore recovery will see low cost environmentally friendly heap leaching take another giant leap forward.

Copper oxide minerals,such as malachite (Cu2(OH)2CO3),azurite (Cu3(OH)2(CO3)2,tenorite (CuO) and chrysocolla (CuSiO3·2H2O)),are easily soluble in either acid or alkaline media [9,11,17].In hydrometallurgical extraction,many leaching agents have been used such as sulfuric acid [5,6],hydrochloric acid,nitric acid&nbsp;.AMMONIA LEACHING IN THE COPPER INDUSTRY: A REVIEWAlthough the use of sulfuric acid in acid leaching process is a conventional method for recovery of copper,in some cases it is necessary to use other reactants such as ammonia.Ammonia has been known as an effective
