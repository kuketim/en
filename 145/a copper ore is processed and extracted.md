## Copper Mining and Extraction Sulfide Ores
Copper can be extracted from its ore by: Underground: sinking a vertical shaft into the Earth to an appropriate depth and driving horizontal tunnels into the ore.Open pit: 90% of ore is mined by this method.Ores near the surface can be quarried after removal of the surface layers.The ore is treated with dilute sulfuric acid.GCSE CHEMISTRY27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Extraction of Metals.Extraction of Copper.Copper is sometimes found as native metal.Copper ores include copper(II) oxide and copper(II) sulfide.Copper(II) oxide can be reduced by reaction with carbon.Some copper ores may contain only small amounts of copper.These are called low grade ores and have less than 1% copper but they are still used because copper is so valuable.
