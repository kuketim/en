## Sulfide Ores
1.1.2 Extraction of Nickel and Cobalt from Sulphide Ores.Sulphide ores were mostly created by (i) the intrusion of molten magma from the mantle into the crust of the earth and (ii) the formation of localized metal rich sulphide ore bodies by sequential solidification and or hydrothermal leaching and precipitation.Processing of Nickel Laterite Ores on the RiseImage: Nickel Ore Dryer.Some novel processes may employ pelletizing at this stage of the process,where drying also facilitates pulverization of the ore in preparation of processing on a disc pelletizer.Pelletizing may also be used as a means of reintroducing recycle to the process.

## Nickel Sulfide Versus Laterite : The Hard Sustainability Challenge …
Nickel is commonly present in two principal ore types sulfide or laterite ores.Sulfide ores are typically derived from volcanic or hydrothermal processes and usually include copper (Cu) and or cobalt,and sometimes other precious metals such as gold or platinumNickel Exploration and Mining outlook and update.RNC describes the Dumont Project as one of the world’s largest undeveloped,permitted and shovel ready nickel sulphide deposits containing approximately 6.1 billion pounds of nickel in the proven and probable reserve categories and 9.75 billion pounds of nickel resources in the measured and indicated category,enough nickel for a year mine.

## Ore
2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals,typically metals,that can be mined,treated and sold at a profit.Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined,often via smelting,to extract the valuable metals or minerals.The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.Nickel Sulfide Versus Laterite : The Hard Sustainability.22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;nickel.Given that many major nickel companies report annually on their sustainability performance,such as Eramet,Inco (now Vale Inco),WMC Resources (now BHP Billiton),Norilsk Nickel,there is data available to examine in detail the differences in the environmental costs of nickel …
