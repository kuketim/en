Concrete is strong in compression,as the aggregate efficiently carries the compression load.However,it is weak in tension as the cement holding the aggregate in place can crack,allowing the structure to fail.Reinforced concrete adds either steel reinforcing bars,steel fibers,aramid fibers,carbon fibers,glass fibers,or plastic fibers to carry tensile loads.Mechanical Properties of Foam Concrete …116 Mechanical Properties of Foam Concrete International Journal of Earth Sciences and Engineering ISSN 0974 5904,Vol.08,No.02,April,2015,pp.115 119
