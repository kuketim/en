## Sugar Cane Industry Overview And Energy Efficiency.
sugar mills having mechanical steam turbines have higher steam consumption due to the poor efficiency of the mechanical steam turbines.Replacement of these turbines with electric drives will improve the electrical power generation since steam will be saved.Keywords: Biomass,sugar cane,energy,polygeneration,modern,bioCement millThis gives good cement performance,and reduces energy consumption by 40% compared with a standard ball mill system.Capacity of cement mills.The cement mills on a cement plant are usually sized for a clinker consumption considerably greater than the output of the plant's kilns.This is for two reasons:

## Grinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process Control
Grinding in ball mills is an important technological process applied to reduce the size of particles which may have different nature and a wide diversity of physical,mechanical and chemical characteristics.Typical examples are the various ores,minerals,limestone,etc.The applications of ball mills are ubiquitous in mineralCalculation of energy required for grinding in a ball mill.Calculation of energy required for grinding in a ball mill.Int.J.Miner.Process.25: 46.The Bond work index,Wi,as an indicator of the grindability of raw materials is not a material constant but rather it changes with change of size of the grinding product.
