## Hydrocyclone Feed Pump &amp; Pressure PSI vs Operating Parameters
For a hydrocyclone to work at peak efficiency the volume of slurry and the feed pump delivery pressure must remain constant.If the cyclone feed pump is allowed to SURGE,the up and down pressure will cause poor separation at the point of high and low operating pressure.AMIT 135: Lesson 2 Circuit Mass Balancing Mining Mill.M w = water weight; This equation is often used to determine the amount of water in a process stream1 knowing the solids concentration by weight and the tons hr of solids in a process stream.Solids Concentration Example.The underflow stream from the classifying cyclon

## Hydrocyclone
A hydrocyclone (often referred to by the shortened form cyclone) is a device to classify,separate or sort particles in a liquid suspension based on the ratio of their centripetal force to fluid resistance.This ratio is high for dense (where separation by density is required) and coarse (where separation by size is required) particles,and low for light and fine particles.AMIT 145: Lesson 2 Classifying Cyclones Mining Mill.Cyclone Fundamentals.A tangential feed injection is used to induce a centrifugal force,which accelerates the particle size settling kinetics.Coarse particles report to the outer wall of the cyclone and spira
