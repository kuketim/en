1 At the start of production,the manufacturer receives titanium concentrates from mines.While rutile can be used in its natural form,ilmenite is processed to remove the iron so that it contains at least 85% titanium dioxide.These materials are put in a fluidized bed reactor acobalt and iron wash: long but with recipes to make upRutile wash: 20 grams Rutile and 5 grams Red Iron Oxide All of the above should be sieved thoroughly (150 mesh if you have it) and thin.Can be sprayed,brushed,poured (I spray pieces that will have oxides poured on
