## STUDY OF THE WORKABILITY AND MECHANICAL …
The objective of this study is to explore the effect of partial and total substitution of river sand by crushing sand in ordinary concrete.Various mixtures were tested to evaluate the properties of fresh and hardened concrete exposed to the water rising from the water table.The river sand was substituted by the limestone sand for the following proportions (0%,30%,40%,50%,60%,70%,and 100%).[PDF] Comparative Study of Compressive Strength of …This paper presents the experimental study to compare the properties of traditional concrete and concrete made up of other supplementary materials.In this study partial replacement of natural sand by marble dust and stone dust and cement by fly ash so as to.
