## Uses of Limestone
Limestone rock is a sedimentary rock which forms in the process of sedimentation at the bottom of lakes and oceans,or in caves.It is mainly composed of mineral calcite and aragonite,both of which are crystal forms of calcium carbonate.A limestone with 95 percent or more of calcium carbonate by weight is known as a high calcium limestone.The Kinetics of Calcination of High Calcium Limestone4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Limestone is one of the most basic raw materials employed in the industry and has been compared to one leg of a six legged stool around which modern industry revolves,the oilier legs being coal,petroleum,iron ore,sulphur and salt [1].Lime (CaO) is one of the oldest chemicals known to man and the process of limes
