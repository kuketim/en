A slurry of ground ore,water and a weak cyanide solution is fed into large steel leach tanks where the gold and silver are dissolved.Following this leaching process the slurry passes through six adsorption tanks containing carbon granules which adsorb the gold and silver.This process removes 93% of the gold and 70% of the silver.DredgingDredging is a four part process: loosening the material,bringing the material to the surface (together extraction),transportation and disposal.[1] The extract can be disposed of locally or transported by barge or in a liquid suspension in kilometre long pipelines.
