Earlier we considered the classification of rocks hardness according to the Protodyakonov scale,where the hardness coefficient bases on the degree of material resistance to compression.There is also another method for determining material hardness this is the Mohs scale of mineral hardness proposed by German mineralogist Friedrich Mohs in 1811.what is the mohs hardness of basaltMohs Scale of Hardness The Moh's (Mohs) scale of hardness is the most common method used to rank gemstones and minerals according to hardness.Devised by German mineralogist Friedrich Moh in 1812,this scale grades minerals on a scale from 1 (very soft

## Rating Minerals on Mohs Scale of Hardness
Mohs hardness scale was devised in 1812 by Friedrich Mohs and has been the same ever since,making it the oldest standard scale in geology.It is also perhaps the most useful single test for identifying and describing minerals.You use the Mohs hardness scale by testing an unknown mineral against one of the standard minerals.Basalt Mohs Hardness ScaleThe rock hardness of basalt is 6 on the Mohs scale,and can be seen through a combination of its compressive stren Mpa Megapascal,its tensile strength 1030 Mpa.The hardness of Granite is 67 and that of Basalt is 6.The types of Granite are.

## Basalt Rock Properties and Uses
The rock hardness of basalt is 6 on the Mohs scale,and can be seen through a combination of its compressive strength: 300 Mpa (Megapascal),its tensile strength: 30 Mpa,and its shear strength: 60 Mpa,which denotes that depending on the mineral makeup,basalt rocks fall in the strong …Mohs Scale of the Ten Hardnesses1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Mohs hardness scale is a test that determines hardness relative to a known group of minerals.If you are trying to find where a material falls on the mohs scale,carbon fiber for instance,you need to be able to have a large enough sample to scratch.By trying to scratch the unknown object with different minerals in the kit you can determine the hardness of the unknown.
