## Foam concrete
Foam concrete,also known as Lightweight Cellular Concrete (LCC),Low Density Cellular Concrete (LDCC),and other terms is defined as a cement based slurry,with a minimum of 20% (per volume) foam entrained into the plastic mortar.[1] As mostly no coarse aggregate is used for production of foam concrete the correct term would be called mortar instead of concrete; it may be called &quot;foamed.Which brick is better,CLC or AAC?Cellular Light Weight Concrete (CLC) and Autoclaved Airated Concrete (AAC) are basically the same,with the difference of how these are cured.Both AAC and CLC blocks are made using cement,flyash,sand and foaming agent.Both are available in dif.
