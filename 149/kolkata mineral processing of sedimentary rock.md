## Classes of Rocks
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Three Classes of Rocks.—The rocks are divided into three great classes: Sedimentary rocks,made of fragments of older rocks more or less water worn or ground to powder,and then spread out and deposited in layers of gravel,sand,mud,etc.to be later consolidated by pressure and natural cementing.The material may also consist more or less of shells of animals or plants,or of minerals.Sedimentary Mineral Deposits2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mechanical Deposition of Sedimentary Mineral Deposits.In some cases,the ore mineral,on account of its resistance to weathering and its hardness,survived the destruction of many of the rock minerals; and,during sedimentation,on account of its weight,it was sorted out from the fragments of quartz and other resistant minerals.
