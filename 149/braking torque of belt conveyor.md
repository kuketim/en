## Motor Brakes
DC injection brakes slow down AC electric motors.Dynamic braking lowers the wear of friction based braking components,and can regenerate energy,saving on operating costs.After disconnecting the AC voltage supplied to an AC motor,DC voltage is injected into the windings of the motor,providing a braking force to the rotor.Design and Control Philosophy of the 47 km NMDC Downhil,Conveyor Brakes Braking Systems for Aggregate Mining.
