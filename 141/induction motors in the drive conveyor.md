## Selecting the Optimal Conveyor Drive
Selecting the Optimal Conveyor Drive This paper suggests several mechanical,electrical,and software ideas that will enable conveyor designers to optimize conveyor reliability and &quot;maintainability&quot; without the need for large investments in equipment and design time.What is droop control in the context of AC motors and …In load sharing applications,droop control varies the drive's output frequency to manipulate motor slip,ensuring that each motor is equally loaded.One of the fundamental characteristics of an AC induction motor is that the rotor spins at a slower rate than that of the stator’s rotating magnetic field.
