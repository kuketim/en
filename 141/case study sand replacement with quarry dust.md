## study of behavior of replacement of sand by quarry dust
The concept of replacement of natural fine aggregate by quarry dust which is highlighted in the study could boost the consumption of quarry dust generated from quarries.By replacement of quarry dust,the requirement of land fill area can be reduced and can also solve the problem of natural sand scarcity.Mukesh B.Patel 1,S.D.Charkha2 IJERA.comconcrete found highest for replacement of sand for 40%,with stone quarry dust.SAHU,SUNIL KUMAR AND sahu,sunil kumar and SACHAN (2) Studied the suitability of crushed stone dust waste as fine aggregate for concrete which has been
