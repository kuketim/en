## Milling (machining)
Milling is a cutting process that uses a milling cutter to remove material from the surface of a work piece.The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool,often with multiple cutting points.As opposed to drilling,where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis,the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter.The Stack: Every LayoutThe vertical spacing of your design should be based on your standard line height because text dominates most pages’ layout,making one line of text a natural denominator.If the body text line height is 1.5 (i.e.1.5 ⨉ the font size),it makes sense to use 1.5 as the ratio for your modular scale.
