## Hot Rolling Mill Hydraulic Gap Control (HGC) thickness.
The mill stretch force can be measured by load cells or calculated from the measured HGC pressure and can be used to calculate the mill stretch.The mill modulus has to be measured during the commissioning of the system.Within the operating range,the elaRawmillA raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into &quot;rawmix&quot; during the manufacture of cement.Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln,which transforms it into clinker,which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement,and has a larg
