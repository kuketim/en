## How to calculate the grinding time of the ball mill.
It is assumed that the ore is continuously discharged from the feeding port to the discharge port.The ball milling time calculated under this ideal state is the minimum grinding time.The filling rate of the ball mill is 40%.If the slurry level reaches 50% filling rate,the slurry will flow out automatically.Nanomilling of Drugs for Bioavailability Enhancement: A,May 20,2016&#0183;&#32;In general,wet stirred mills impart higher power density than planetary mills and rotating ball mills,and achieve the production of nanosuspensions faster Regardless of milling equipment,a longer milling process usually allows for the production of smaller particles [5,47,97] A longer milling is associated with more bead bead collisions.
