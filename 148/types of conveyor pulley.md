## Pulleys: Beginners Guide Basics of conveyor pulleys
Generally,pulleys are located at the ends of the conveyor structure and at the take up arrangement.Pulleys are used to transmit the drive power into the conveyor belt and as such,are subjected to the dynamic belt tension forces in a conveyor.There are a number of different types of pulleys available for use on conveyors&nbsp;.Conveyor Belt PulleysConveyor belt pulleys are installed on powered belt conveyors to drive the belt,redirect the belt back to the drive pulley,or help maintain the belt's tracking so it follows the desired path during conveying.The pulleys are mounted on shafts that engage the bearings and drive mechanisms used to support the pulley and power the belt.
