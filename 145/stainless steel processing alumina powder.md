## Alumina Manufacturing process of Alumina
Alumina,synthetically produced aluminum oxide (Al2O3),is a white crystalline substance that is used as a starting material for the production of aluminum metal.The world wide production is close to 90 million tons of alumina per year.The Bayer process is the principal industrial means of refining bauxite to produce alumina.29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;According to Lumely et al.[10],wetting of alumina is affected by reaction between magnesium and alumina at the metal oxide interface,forming MgAl2O4,which is thought to modify and rupture the oxide ?lm on the surface of the molten aluminium exposingAlumina ceramic materialsAlumina,or aluminum oxide,with a molecular weight of 102,is the major source of aluminum in nature.Alumina has very high melting point,which is 2,072 &#176;C and it is extremely hard.Alumina ceramic is the most common technical ceramic material and a relatively traditional material.The chosen method is the hydrolysis and poly condensation of organometallic precursor (to form a gel) and the dip coating process (to deposit the matured gel on the stainless steel).All the processing parameters are controlled: the gel viscosity,the dipping speed,the grain size of alumina powder added to the gel and the conditions to.

## Investigation of stainless steel 316L zirconia joint part.
Stainless steel 316L (SUS316L) provided by Atmix,Japan and zirconia powder provided by Nanolab,Korea were used in this study.The chemical composition and characteristics of the 2 powders are summarized in Table 1 and 2.Powder particle size was measured by the laser scattering method.Alibaba.com offers 134 precision ceramic processing alumina products.About 61% of these are ceramics.A wide variety of precision ceramic processing alumina options are available to you,such as ceramic plates,ceramic raw materials,and ceramic rods.Semisolid State Sintering Behavior of Aluminum Stainless.7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;50 vol.% of the SUS316L powder were mixed with heptane in a stainless steel jar on a ball mill (SMBL,SciLabMixŠ,Programmable Ball Mill,Seoul,Korea) for 12 h at 200 rpm; 75 mL of heptane and alumina balls were used as the process control agents (PCAs).The heptane was evaporated naturally.After ballMetal matrix composites (MMC) find their uses as high performing materials.The selective laser melting (SLM) of a 316L stainless steel and Al2O3 MMC is presented in this paper.Agglomerate Al2O3 particles had shown to be an adequate powder choice with uniform dispersions in the resultant prints.Relative density,phase,microstructure and mechanical properties of all,wt% doped.
