## Ore genesis
Sulfide phases only form in ultramafic magmas when the magma reaches sulfur saturation.This is generally thought to be nearly impossible by pure fractional crystallisation,so other processes are usually required in ore genesis models to explain sulfur saturation.Ore deposits formed by oxidation and supergene enrichmentOre Deposits Formed by Oxidation and Supergene Enrichment &#183; When ore deposits are exposed to the oxidation zone they are weathered and altered with the country rocks.&#183; The surface waters oxidize many ore minerals and yield solvents that dissolve other minerals.&#183; An orebody thus becomes oxidized and generally leached of many of its valuable materials down to the groundwater table,or to.

## Gold
This is a complex gold ore with oxide gold in a quartz vein with sulfide gold.The sulfide gold is too fine to see,it was probably hydrothermally deposited as a replacement for the iron and pyrites (dark holes) that reduced and oxidized to iron (staining the ore),leaving cavities for gold to enter with the water or steam.(My theory)Effect of Pretreatment of Sulfide Refractory Concentrate.The majority of the refractory gold and silver occurs in occlusion in sulphides,then precious metal dissolution is possible by first oxidizing auriferous sulfide concentrate using sodium hypochlorite sodium hydroxide solution followed of pressure cyanidation of the oxidized concentrate,for the extraction of precious metals.This process was conducted and evaluated under cyanide and oxygen.

Generally,the oxidation rate is maximal at 20% solids for high sulfide content materials [ca.30% sulfur].Low grade ores [1% sulfur] have been successfully oxidized at 55% solids,indicating a link between the sulfide grade of the material and the optimal solids concentration for operation.Biooxidation1) Two types of sulfide ores.To the left sulfur (yellow) is bound to a metal (green),for example copper.To the right sulfur (yellow) is bound to a metal (blue),for example iron.Elemental metal (red),for example gold,is enclosed trapped hosted in the sulfide matrix to the right.2) Bioleaching and biooxidation are both oxidation processes.

## Roasting (metallurgy)
Roasting is a process of heating of sulfide ore to a high temperature in presence of air.It is a step of the processing of certain ores.More specifically,roasting is a metallurgical process involving gas solid reactions at elevated temperatures with the goal of purifying the metal component(s).Often before roasting,the ore has already been partially purified,e.g.by froth flotation.Sulfide Oxidation with Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2)Sulfide Oxidation with Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) Sulfide Odor Control.Sulfide is found throughout the environment as a result of both natural and industrial processes.Most sulfide found in nature was produced biologically (under anaerobic conditions) and occurs as free hydrogen sulfide (H2S) characterized by its rotten egg odor.
