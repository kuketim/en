## Dry beneficiation of coal : a review
However,dry beneficiation of coal has obvious advantages over wet processes.The dry processes for coal are based on the physical properties of coal and its associated mineral matters.Different types of equipment for dry beneficiation have been developed,based on the exploitation of physical properties such as density,size,shape,magnetic susceptibility,and electrical conductivity.Dry beneficiation technology of coal with an air dense …Dry beneficiation of coal with an air dense medium fluidized bed (ADMFB) uses a pseudofluid system of the mix of dense medium (such as magnetite powder) and fine coal powder as the separating.
