## Chemistry Tutorial : Copper Smelting
The earliest evidence of copper smelting occurs in Serbian artefacts dating from around 5000 BC Copper can,sulfide during the smelting process because copper has a higher affinity for sulfur than it does for oxygen for example: Cu 2 O + FeS → Cu 2 S + FeO,(electrolytic refining) Refining: increases the purity of the copper by.Copper Smelting ProcessCopper Smelting Process Furnaces Used,By Products,and Process Used to Smelt Copper.Manufacturing Technology By Willie Scott Mechanical Engineering.Introduction to Copper Smelting Techniques.Copper ore typically contains only about 0.6% of the actual copper mineral,the most common ore mined being chalcopyrite.The ore is attained.
