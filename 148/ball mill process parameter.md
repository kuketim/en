## A study on the effect of process parameters in stirred.
In the current study,the process performance (grinding efficiency) of grinding inorganic powder into fine particles using wet grinding with a stirred ball mill was investigated by examining how specific surface areas of ground products are affected by the process parameters.Identification of Optimal Mill Operating Parameters during.The approach proposed provides more accurate information for the reliable description of the grinding process and enables the scale up of laboratory results to larger scale mills.Future work will focus on the evaluation and exploration o
