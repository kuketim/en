## Coal explained
Coal is classified into four main types,or ranks: anthracite,bituminous,subbituminous,and lignite.The ranking depends on the types and amounts of carbon the coal contains and on the amount of heat energy the coal can produce.The rank of a coal deposit is determined by the amount of pressure and heat that acenvironment exam 3 Flashcards QuizletThe prevalence of &quot;throwaway mentalities&quot; and increased packaging have amplified the consumption of paper and plastic in our society.Disposable plates,cups,and utensils are convenient,sanitary,and inexpensive,and packaging preserves freshness,prevents breakage,protects against tampering,provides information to consumers,and allows shipment of products over long distances.
