## Leach Solution
The differences among these patents were in the pretreatment and procedures of leaching,such as hot acid leaching (about 150 C) after the calcination (Braconnier and Rollat,2012; Porob et al.2011),acid leaching with heating under reflux (Fu et al.2012).4 Factors Affecting Gold VAT Leaching ProcessGold vat leaching process is currently widely used in small scale gold mines,because of a series of advantages including high recovery rate,strong adaptability to ore,low cost and simple process.Now,we're going to talk about the factors affecting gold vat leaching process.

## Effect of Temperature on Cyanidation and Gold Leaching …
Effect of Temperature on Cyanidation and Silver Leaching Kinetic Rates In practice the use of hot solutions for the extraction of gold from an ore has many disadvantages such as the cost of heating the ore and solution,the increased decomposition of cyanide due to heat,the increased consumption of cyanide due to the accelerated reaction between cyanicides in the ore such as sulphides of.Heap Leaching2.1 Leaching.Most copper leaching is done by piling broken ore (∼0.5% Cu) into flat surface,3 10m high,10 4 10 5 m 2 heaps of ore and then sprinkling dilute sulfuric acid lixiviant on to the heap surface.The lixiviant trickles down through the heap and leaches copper from its minerals to produce a pregnant leach solution containing 1 5kg Cum −3.
