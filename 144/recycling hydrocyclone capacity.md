## Hydrocyclone
26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Working Principle.Hydrocyclone is a continuous device that utilizes centrifugal force to accelerate the settling rate of particles.When feed slurry enters the hydrocyclone tangentially under pressure,as result of the high centrifugal forces,particles coarser than the “cut point” size migrate into a primary vortex adjacent to the wall and move forward to discharge with a small volume of.Herbold introduces hydrocyclone technologyHerbold introduces hydrocyclone technology.Electronics Recycling Asia 2015 was organized by Switzerland based ICM AG and held at the Shangri La Hotel in Singapore Nov.13.The crude steel capacity utilization ratio for the 66 countries in October 2015 was 68.3 percent.This is 3.4 percentage points lower than in October 2014.
