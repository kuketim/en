8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The leading suppliers offer their outlook on the current state of gravity separation technology.By Simon Walker,European Editor.With the possible exception of visual sorting—”this one’s green,this one’s not,” or however the Bronze Age equivalent ran—being able to separate minerals using differences in their density is the most ancient mineral processing technique known to man.Mineral Processing Equipment &amp; Solutions Sepro …Gravity separation has been used for centuries to separate different minerals and metals based on their specific gravity.Some of the earliest recordings of this science in practice are from Ancient Egypt as workers panned for gold in the Nile river.While today’s.

## Why is dewatering an important process in mineral …
Mineral processing is extremely water demanding.Gallons upon gallons of water are used for solids transportation,grinding,classification,and flotation.Not only this,but the high grade ore bodies are becoming more scarce or “mined out” so the.Mineral processing metallurgy Britannica5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mineral processing,art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock,or gangue.It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy.The primary operations are comminution and concentration,but there are other important operations.

## Gravity separation
Gravity separation obtained the widest distribution at the end of 19 and at the beginning of the th century,when output of natural resources sharply increased.Gravity separation is actual even nowadays,which is connected with its principle advantages cheapness and possibility of separation mineral particles of different range of sizes ( from 0,1 up to 300 mm) by different methods.Gravity Separation Gravity Separator Machine for Sale7 Advantages of gravity separator machine Gravity separation of ores is capable of various particle sizes at low cost,coarse (greater than 25 mm),medium (25 to 2 mm) and fine (2 to 0.075 mm) ore.Gravity separation metallurgy has a high processing capacity
