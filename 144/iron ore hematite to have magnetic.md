Jan 18,2015&#0183;&#32;Hematite the mineral is essentially non magnetic but often exhibits weak attraction to powerful rare earth magnets or industrial strength electromagnets Anything more than that is usually due to the presence of magnetite as a secondary mineral,and that could well be unevenly distributed in hematite rich iron ore depositsIs Hematite Magnetic? SciencingNatural hematite is sometimes weakly magnetic,but won't attract metals or other pieces of hematite.Hemalyke,hematin and similar synthetic stones do not usually contain any real hematite,but can be polished to resemble natural hematite and have a strong magnetic field.

## Hematite Processing by Flotation
Deposits of comparatively low grade specular hematite amenable to beneficiation by flotation have produced concentrates superior in grade to direct shipping ores.Low grade deposits containing specular hematite (Fe2 O3) as the major iron mineral as low as 25% Fe can be treated with “Sub A” Flotation to produce concentrates that average better than 62% Fe with less than 9% SiO2 and with a.Hematite WikipediaHematite is colored black to steel or silver gray,brown to reddish brown,or red It is mined as the main ore of iron Varieties include kidney ore,martite (pseudomorphs after magnetite),iron rose and specularite (specular hematite) While these forms vary,they all have a rust red streak Hematite is harder than pure iron,but much more.

## Iron Geoscience Australia
The minerals that are mostly used as ore for making iron are hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) Iron is quite soft and easily worked,but it has a very high melting point of 1538&#176;C Iron and some alloys of iron are also magneticHematiteSuch crystals are known as specular hematite (also specularite and iron glance) because of better light reflectance The habit of crystals is versatile as well It may form botryoidal kidney ores which have a radial fibrous structure (pencil ore) in the interior of the crystal Hematite may be platy (micaceous hematite)
