## Monitoring the fill level of a ball mill using vibration.
Ball mills are extensively used in the size reduction process of different ores and minerals.The fill level inside a ball mill is a crucial parameter which needs to be monitored regularly for optimal operation of the ball mill.In this paper,a vibration monitorInvestigation on measuring the fill level of an industrial.Fig.12 shows the variation in the average RMS value of the mill shell vibration with fill level.In most cases,at the same fill level the RMS value is higher for higher ball loads than for lower ball loads,as shown in Table 4 and Fig.12.However,the influence on the vi
