## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.SAG Mill&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;SAG mill can be applied as the first stage grinding equipment.It can effectively avoid the occurrence of sliming phenomenon,and avoid further grinding of fine particles.It can play a good role in controlling granularity and energy saving.
