## Gold mining
Historically,mercury was used extensively in placer gold mining in order to form mercury gold amalgam with smaller gold particles,and thereby increase the gold recovery rates.Large scale use of mercury stopped in the 1960s.However,mercury is still used in artisanal and small scale gold mining (ASGM),often clandestine,gold prospecting.The Basics of Successful Gold Mining Part 1Successful gold mining is generally done in two steps: First is sampling or prospecting.Most gold bearing rivers have a certain amount of low grade gold values dispersed throughout the gravel.The general gold path tends to have more gold along it than the average gravel throughout the rest of the river.This method is generally used.
