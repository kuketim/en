## Ash Handling System In Thermal Power Plant
• Availability of Coal: Huge amount of coal is required for raising the steam Since the government policy is to use the only low grade coal with 30 to 40 % ash content for power generation purposes,the steam power plants should be located near the coal mines to avoid the transport of coal & ashWhat is role of Coal handling in power plant?In the Coal Based Thermal Power Plants,where the initial process to generate electricity is the handling the huge or tremendous amount of Coal.* Usually Coal will be transported to plant through Railway Wagons (If it is a Pithead Power station t.
