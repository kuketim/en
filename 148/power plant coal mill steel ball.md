## Coal Mill
The coal is grinded into pulverized coal in the coal ball mill mainly by means of three ways: press,strike and grind.Among them,the first way is the most energy saving,and the last one most energy consuming.During the milling process,all kinds of coal mills use two or three of these ways.Product characteristics:Mining Industry: What is a coal mill?&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;To grind coal to fine powder for further firing at the huge huge burners fitted in the water walls of boilers in the coal fired thermal power plants mainly to heat water and convert to high pressure,high temperature steam,steam to be fed in turb.
