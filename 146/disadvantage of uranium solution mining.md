## Leaching
Insitu leaching is also known as insitu recovery,or solution mining.This is especially used to extract copper and uranium.In this process,holes are drilled into the ore deposit by explosive or hydraulic fracturing methods.The leaching solution is then pumped through these channels.The solution that dissolves the ore is then pumped out and.6 Potential Environmental Effects of Uranium Mining,Acidic mine water is more likely to contain heavy metals (eg,iron,manganese,aluminum,copper,chromium,zinc,lead,vanadium,cobalt,or nickel) or metalloids (eg,selenium or arsenic) released into solution by oxidation of the sulfide,
