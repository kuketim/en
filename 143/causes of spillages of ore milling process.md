## MILLING CONTROL & OPTIMISATION Mintek
ore treated was very difficult to mill.In the first two days,the mill experienced numerous power dips (overloads),and on at least seven occasions the feed to the mill had to be completely stopped to grind the mill out.Also,the mill load varied in the range of 125 to 165 tons.These disturbances propagated throughout the milling circuit and.www.wenkuxiazai.com本文档下载自 HYPERLINK &quot;https: www.wenkuxiazai.com &quot; 文库下载网，内容可能不完整，您可以点击以下网址继续阅读或下载： http: www.
