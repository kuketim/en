## Shielding Materials
Most of these have a high nickel content,with either 50% or 80% nickel in the mix.Specialized magnetic shielding materials usually have a higher relative permeability,but a lower saturation point.Permeability is the degree of magnetization of a material that responds linearly to an applied magnetic field.The Three Most Popular EMI Shielding Metals and What …Carbon steel has a permeability value in the lower hundreds range which provides the low frequency magnetic shielding property that is missing in alloy 770,copper,or aluminum.The tin plating offers corrosion protection for the steel to prevent rusting as well as providing a great solderable surface to attach the shield to the traces on the surface board during assembly.

## Magnetic Properties of 304 &amp; 316 Stainless Steel
The presence of nickel in the stainless steel alloys stabilizes austenite against this phase transition as the alloy cools to room temperature.This corresponds to a somewhat larger magnetic susceptibility than we might expect for other nonmagnetic materials,but is still well below what might be considered magnetic.
