## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotatiLatest Technology Low Consumption Mm Adi Grinding Ball For.A continuous gratedischarge tumbling mill with grinding balls does seldom have ball size below 20 mm since you then will have unacceptable media losses or problem with grate throughput to get energy efficient grinding below approx 40 m you need t

As such,when the product is sticky,rod mills are preferred over ball mills.Rod mills have an industrial yield that is less than that of a ball mill,which explains the fact that balls have a much larger grinding surface than rods.The power needed to operate a rod mill could exceed 30% of the power used in a ball mill.Bond Tests Mining SGSBond Rod Mill Grindability Test.The test determines the Bond Rod Mill Work Index which is used with Bond’s Third Theory of Comminution to calculate net power requirements when sizing ball mills*.Various correction factors may have to be applied.The test is a closed circuit dry grindability

## Energy efficiency
The use of tower mills as an energy efficient alternative to secondary and regrind ball milling became a common inclusion in the latter part of the previous century.Traditionally the higher energy efficiency was attributed to the difference between attrition grinding in tower mills and impact grinding in ball milling.Energy Use of Fine Grinding in Mineral ProcessingFine grinding,to P80 sizes as low as 7&amp;nbsp;μm,is becoming increasingly important as mines treat ores with smaller liberation sizes.This grinding is typically done using stirred mills such as the Isamill or Stirred Media Detritor.While fine grinding consumes less energy than primary grinding,it can still account for a substantial part of a mill’s energy budget.Overall energy use and.
