## Analysis on the grinding operation condition of ball mill.
The ball mill and the rod mill are the most commonly used grinding equipment in the dressing plant,so what is the difference between the operation of the two grinding equipment? Sometimes we think,why do we have a ball mill for a dressing plant,but with a rod mill,why? Today we analyze the problem from the point of view of the operation.to make a differenceBall and Rod Mill&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The Ball and Rod Mill type LMBRM is a process and laboratory machine,which is suitable for milling and homogenizing soft,fibrous,hard and brittle materials in dry and wet phase.

Rod mill is roughly as same as the ball mill,but there are three distinct differences:.1.The rod mill normally uses the steel rod of 50 100mm as the medium,and the ball mill uses steel ball as the medium.The length of steel rod is 25 to 50mm shorter than the barrel body,the load of rod quantity is 35% to 45% of the effective volume of the rod mill.Industrial Ball Mills: Steel Ball Mills and Lined Ball.Ball Mills Steel Ball Mills &amp; Lined Ball Mills.Particle size reduction of materials in a ball mill with the presence of metallic balls or other media dates back to the late 1800‚Äôs.The basic constructi

Rod mills have an industrial yield that is less than that of a ball mill,which explains the fact that balls have a much larger grinding surface than rods.The power needed to operate a rod mill could exceed 30% of the power used in a ball mill.When they are worn,rods must not stretch but break in rather small pieces,soOptimization of mill performance by usingOptimization of mill performance by using online ball and pulp measurements by B.Clermont* and B.de Haas* Synopsis Ball mills are usually the largest consumers of energy within a mineral concentrator.Comminution is responsible for 50% of the total mineral processing cost.In today‚
