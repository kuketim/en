Raw material ball mill,also known as raw material mill,is a commonly used grinding equipment in mineral processing process.Raw material mill is mainly divided into dry raw material mill,wet raw material mill,cement raw material mill and so on.It is often used for grindiMVR vertical roller mill with planetary.For the preparation of cement raw material,cement,and granulated blast furnace slag with small to medium output rates,the MVR mill with conventional drive is the right choice.This mill type is by the way the core piece of our modular ready2grind system.

## Rawmill
A raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into &quot;rawmix&quot; during the manufacture of cement.Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln,which transforms it into clinker,which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement,and has a …Cement mills and raw mills for high throughput ratesNo matter what type of material has to be ground cement raw material,cement clinker or granulated blast furnace slag and how different their grindability and abrasiveness may be,the MVR mill ensures throughput rates of a different dimension,around the clock,reliably and on the long term.Forget about downtime.

## Raw Mill Feeding
After monitoring and controlling the quality of incoming raw material,the area of high activity for quality department to ensure quality mix for smooth production of high quality of cement is “mill feeding system”.The system consists of material hoppers bins,weighing,conveying,venting and mill feedBest energy consumptionCorrect timing on the maintenance of a first chamber cement mill lining and the successful implementation of an expert system on a cement mill both offer benefits in terms of power consumption (see case studies panel).Accurate process measurements are also key to energy saving opportunities.Air compressors are another area for attention.
