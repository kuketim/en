## Ball mill
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.Grinding &amp; Classification CircuitsThe work index value is useful to get down to a typical ball mill product size,such as 100 &#181;m,but you can't use work index below about 50 &#181;m because the exponent of &#189; is wrong you need to use a model like Von Rittinger or a signature plot to get from 100 &#181;m to 40 &#181;m.
