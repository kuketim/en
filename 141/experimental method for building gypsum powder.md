## Angle of repose
The angle of repose,or critical angle of repose,[1] of a granular material is the steepest angle of descent or dip relative to the horizontal plane to which a material can be piled without slumping.At this angle,the material on the slope face is on the verge of sliding.The angle of repose can range from 0&#176; to 90&#176;.The morphology of the.Compression Molding of Gypsum Blocks Using Ecological Brick …Compression Molding of Gypsum Blocks Using Ecological Brick Machines Ana Cecilia Vieira da N&#243;brega1,a,Germano Gomes Leite2,b,Humberto Correia Lima J&#250;nior1,c,Normando Perazzo Barbosa3,d and Ulisses Targino Bezerra4,e 1UFPE,Pernambuco,Brazil.
