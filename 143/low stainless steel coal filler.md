## Welding Carbon Steel to Stainless Steel
Stainless steel can be the steel of choice for many applications,but when it comes to heavy fabrication,the cost of creating large pieces entirely from stainless can be cost prohibitive.This creates an opportunity for engineers to only use stainless steel in specific areas,for instance in areas of high heat or corrosive areas,then matching unspecified areas to a mild steel.Stainless SteelExtra low carbon stainless steel electrode for welding steels of the 19Cr10Ni type.Also suitable for welding stabilized stainless steels of the similar composition,except when the full creep resistance of the base material is to be met.[Read more]
