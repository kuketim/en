## Bauxite tailings
Bauxite tailings,also known as bauxite residue,red mud,red sludge,or alumina refinery residues (ARR),is a highly alkaline waste product composed mainly of iron oxide that is generated in the industrial production of alumina (aluminium oxide,the principal raw material used in the manufacture of aluminium metal and also widely used in the manufacture of ceramics,abrasives and refractories).Aluminum Is the Planet's Most Abundant ElementBauxite normally contains 60% aluminum oxide (commonly referred to as alumina) and is regularly found near the earth's surface.This process can be separated into two parts; (1) the extraction of alumina from bauxite,and (2),the smelting of aluminum metal
