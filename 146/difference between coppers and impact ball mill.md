## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotatiBall millThe difference in speeds between the balls and grinding jars produces an interaction between frictional and impact forces,which releases high dynamic energies.The interplay between these forces produces the high and very effective degree of size reduction of t
