## Mechanical Milling: a Top Down Approach for the Synthesis.
The tumbler ball mill is operated closed to the critical speed beyond which the balls are pinned to the inner walls of the mill because of the centrifugal force dominating over centripetal force.For large scale production tumbler mills are more economical when compared to the other high energy ball mills[26].Ball millA ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.
