## Surface mining
Surface mining,including strip mining,open pit mining and mountaintop removal mining,is a broad category of mining in which soil and rock overlying the mineral deposit (the overburden) are removed,in contrast to underground mining,in which the overlying rock is left in place,and the mineral is removed through shafts or tunnels.Surface.The Actual Difference Between Surface and UndergroundIn surface mining,the ore is accessed directly from the Earth's surface,and contact is maintained with the surface throughout the operation.Underground or subsurface mining is accomplished with the help of tunnels going into the Earth,and does not occur on the surface.Working Principle.In surface mining,the topsoil and bedrock is
