## Ball Mill
The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.Quick and Easy Black Powder Ball Mill — Skylighter,Inc.This project will not attempt to be a comprehensive review of ball milling.For more detail,Lloyd Sponenburgh's comprehensive manual on hobbyist ball milling,&quot;Ball Milling Theory and Practice for the Amateur Pyrotechnician&quot; (BK0005),is considered the bible on this subject.

## Ball Mill Grinding
Some of the characteristics of dry batch ball milling were unlike those of wet grinding.In the dry work,efficiency as well as capacity were best with the light ore charge.Power decreased with decrease in the amount of ore in the mill; in wet grinding it increased with a decrease in the amount of ore in the mill.Dry ball mill,Ball mill for sale,Grinding ball mill.In powder grinding plant,ball grinding process flow includes crushing,milling,air classifying,packing,silos,bucket elevator,conveying,etc.Grinded material discharges from outlet grit fluently.Ball grinding mill is Formed a closed system with air classifier.
