Data mining is a technique dedicated to data analysis and understanding and to reveal the knowledge contained in data.It has become one of the important goals of the application of information.Mining experimental data for dynamical invariantsWe demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion tracking data captured from various physical systems,ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double pendula.Without any prior knowledge about physics,kinematics,or geometry,the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians,Lagrangians,and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation.
