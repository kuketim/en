A data flow diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation of the &quot;flow&quot; of data through an information system,modelling its process aspects.A DFD is often used as a preliminary step to create an overview of the system,which can later be elaborated.DFDs can also be used for the visualization of data processing (structured design).Design elementsThe vector stencils library &quot;Industrial equipment&quot; contains 81 symbols of pumps,compressors,fans,turbines,and power generators.Use these shapes to design pumping systems,air and fluid compression systems,and industrial process diagrams.&quot;Process engineering focuses on the design,operation,control,and optimization of chemical,physical,and biological processes.
