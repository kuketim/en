## Alumina Refining The Aluminum Association
Alumina is the common name given to aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3).Alumina is produced from bauxite,an ore that is mined from topsoil in various tropical and subtropical regions.The Bayer process,discovered in 1887,is the primary process by which alumina is extracted from bauxite.To prodHow aluminum foil is madeThe aluminum industry in the United States in 2014 produced 1.72 million metric tons of primary aluminum,worth 3.97 billion dollars,at nine aluminum smelters.In addition,the US produced 1.70 million tons of secondary aluminum from old (post consumer) scrap,and 1.93 million tons of aluminum from new (manufacturing) scrap.

## Rawmill
A raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into &quot;rawmix&quot; during the manufacture of cement.Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln,which transforms it into clinker,which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement,and has a largHow aluminum foil is madeAluminum foil is made from an aluminum alloy which contains between 92 and 99 percent aluminum.Usually between 0.00017 and 0.0059 inches thick,foil is produced in many widths and strengths for literally hundreds of applications.It is used to manufacture ther
