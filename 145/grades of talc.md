Talc milling processes do not usually alter the mineral composition of the talc mixture delivered to the mill,but rather produce a talc with different physical properties dependent on particle size.Exposure to talc dust occurs during mining,crushing,separating,bagging,loading and in end use facilities,such as rubber dusting and addition of talcs to ceramic clays and glazes.Talc ImerysTalc deposits result from the transformation of existing rocks under the effect of hydrothermal fluids carrying one or several of the components needed to form the mineral.Tectonics play a major role in the genesis of a talc deposit as they enable hydrothermal fluids to penetrate the rock,creating a micro permeability that facilitates reactions in the mass.
