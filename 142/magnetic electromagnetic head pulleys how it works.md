## Magnetic Head Pulley Metal Recycling & Sorting GTEK
Introduction Magnetic Pulley or Magnetic Head Pulley is usually installed at the end of the belt conveyor and is suitable for the automatic separation of iron filings,iron pieces,iron blocks or other ferromagnetic materials from large quantities of dry materials such as ore,grains,sand,gravel,plastics,wood,broken glass,waste,etc Featur The surface material of magnetic pulley.ElectromagnetsElectromagnetism and magnetism Magnets have a north pole and a south pole.Like poles repel but opposite poles attract.Electromagnets,motors,bells and compasses use magnetic fields.

## Magnetic Head Pulleys Magnetic Conveyors for Industrial Use
How a Magnetic Pulley works A Head Pulley Magnet is a self cleaning magnet which removes foreign tramp metals from bulk materials on a belt conveyor The magnetic field adheres ferrous contaminants to the belt as clean product passes over the head pulley Tramp metals from the underflow can be safely captured in a bin to be discardedElectromagnetic Pulleys Separator PulleysElectromagnetic Pulleys come equipped with a Variable Voltage Control Rectifier which can be remotely mounted at the most convenient work location.For these applications,Walker Magnetics offers Electromagnetic Pulleys rather than the permanent magnets.
