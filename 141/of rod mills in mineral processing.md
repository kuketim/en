## Mineral processing
The primarily used equipment in crushing are jaw crushers,gyratory crushers and cone crushers whereas rod mills and ball mills,closed circuited with a classifier unit,are generally employed for grinding purposes in a mineral processing plant.Crushing is a dry process whereas grinding is generally performedRod mills,how they functionWet grinding rod mills are normally used in the mineral processing industry.Dry grinding is used in some areas; however,it is confronted with problems and should be avoided except where absolutely necessary.Rod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills s

## Tubular Rod Mills
The design characteristics of industrial rod mills are similar to ball mills.Most rod mills used in mineral processing are of the overflow discharge type as illustrated in Figure 7.2a.Centre peripheral (Figure 7.2c) and end peripheral discharge mills (Figure 8.1) are also in use.The feed end is generally fitted with spout feeders,scoop feeders,double scoop feeders or drum feeders.
