## Electrochemical Grinding: Working,Application,…
With the rotation of the grinding wheel,metal is removed from the workpiece by the simultaneous electrolytic and abrasive action.Abrasive grains on the surface of the wheel serve to act as a paddle which picks up the electrolyte and cause pressure to a build at the work area.Metallographic Grinding Machines &amp; Polishing …Grinding and polishing is the final stage in the sample preparation process and consists of several steps.Each step uses finer abrasive than the previous one,the ultimate goal being to produce a deformation free,scratch free and highly reflective sample surface.

## Electroplating
Electroplating is a process that uses an electric current to reduce dissolved metal cations so that they form a thin coherent metal coating on an electrode.The term is also used for electrical oxidation of anions on to a solid substrate,as in the formation of silver chloride on silver wire to …electrolytic grinding processElectrolytic Etching.Electrolytic etching requires a homogeneous conductive workpiece.The initial required polishing of the surface can be in the form of short mechanical grinding and polishing which results in a more plane surface,but with deformation and or scratches.Electrolytic RefiningMineral Processing &amp; Metallurgy.Electro refining.

## ELECTROLYTIC GRINDING Cad cam Engineering …
In the process of electrolytic grinding (ELG),an abrasive wheel much like a standard grinding wheel is used.The abrasive wheel bond is metal,thus making it a conducting Wheel cathode medium.The abrasive grains in the grinding wheel are nonconducting and aid in removing oxides from the workpiece while helping maintain the gap between wheel.Electrolytic cut off grinding machine for composite …The machine uses a combined system of grinding and electrolysis and it can cut off a fragile composite material consisting of metal and non metal components.Its fundamental performance is examined on low carbon steel and cast iron.
