The four unmined sites were located in upland forest comparable to that which was mined for bauxite.All seven sites were at least 200 m apart,and most considerably more.Each site was surveyed during the non breeding season (summer) for one hour on three separate occasions between the hours of 0600 and 0930,over a two week period.How aluminium is producedThe next stage in the production chain is the processing of bauxite into alumina,or aluminium oxide Al 2 O 3, a white powder.The most common process for making alumina from bauxite is the Bayer process,which was first discovered over 100 years ago but is still in wide use today.

## Bauxite Mining The Australian Aluminium Council
Bauxite Mining.Scrapers and small excavators are used to remove the remaining overburden and expose the caprock.Depending on the depth of the caprock,it can be broken by blasting,or simply removed with scrapers and excavators.The bauxite is then mined using excavators or loaders to load the bauxite onto haul trucks and transported to the.How much does it cost to mine for copperWhen you consider that ONE of the off road dump trucks used to haul ore from the pit to the processing plant is $350,000,and that it will burn $500 worth of fuel an hour,the costs are staggering.
