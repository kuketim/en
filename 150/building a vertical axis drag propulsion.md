## Vertical Axis Wind Turbine
Drag may be created when the blade rotates into the wind.It is difficult to mount vertical axis turbines on towers,meaning they are often installed nearer to the base on which they rest,such as the ground or a building rooftop.VERTICAL AXIS WIND TURBINESVertical axis turbines do not need such a control system; and can catch the wind from all directions.Vertical axis wind turbines designs can be either impulse (drag) or lift (aerodynamic) devices.According to Betz’s equation,an aerodynamic turbine

Vertical kicking forces you to hammer down on the upkick.Our upkick (or downkick for you backstrokers) will never be as strong as our downkick.We lack the musculature to make a completely even powered kick a reality,but that doesn’t mean that the “weak” side of the kicking motion should be neglected.Environment &amp; Energy : VERTICAL AXIS INVOLUTE SPIRAL …The vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) pictured above is a “drag” propulsion device along with strong “lift” components that allow the rim speed to be faster than the wind speed,which continually diverts the mass of the wind to perform work on the sail.
