## Clastic Sedimentary Rocks
Clastic sedimentary rocks are classified according to the grain size of the sediment and the kinds of rock fragments that make up the sediment (Table ).Grain size is largely a function of the distance the particle was transported.In general,the greater the distance traveled,the smaller and moreClastic Sedimentary Rock ClassificationSedimentary rocks are classified on the basis of the texture (grain size) of the rock,and composition.The basic classification only concerned texture,using the Wentworth size scale.But any full rock name must specify both texture and composition.Thus,an arkose sandstone is a rock of sand sized particles,with a high percentage of those particles being feldspar.

## Sedimentary rock
Clastic sedimentary rocks are composed of other rock fragments that were cemented by silicate minerals.Clastic rocks are composed largely of quartz,feldspar,rock (lithic) fragments,clay minerals,and mica; any type of mineral may be present,but they in general represent the minerals that exist locally.Clastic sedimentary rocks,are subdivided according to the ‚Ä¶Rock The MillRock The Mill 50 Dickson Street,Cambridge,Ontario N1R 8S1 Rated 4.5 based on 2 Reviews &quot;I do not Know what my picture is doing here but I know Chad.

## Clastic rock
Clastic rocks are composed of fragments,or clasts,of pre existing rock.Although,in principle,almost any rock made of eroded former rock is clastic (such as sandstone or mudstone),in practice the term is used for clasts of at least gravel size upwards.That means clasts are at least visible to the naked eye,and may be huge.
