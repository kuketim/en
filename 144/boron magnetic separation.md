## Magnetic Materials
Magnetic Materials Used in Puritan Permanent Type Separation Products There are a couple of choices of magnetic materials to consider when choosing a magnetic separator ; ceramic and rare earth.Both of these are permanent magnets and will retain their full magnetic strength losing approximately &#189; of 1% per 100 years if not subjected to.Boron Nitride Elcan IndustriesBoron Nitride is a ceramic powder that has very strong thermal properties which make it a common powder used in high temperature equipment.Screening boron nitride is a difficult process due to the stickiness and lack of flowability of the powder.Sieving boron.
