## Chalcopyrite an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The principal copper ore mineral is chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2),which is commonly smelted to yield a matte containing ∼50% copperIn the presence of silica flux,iron is selectively oxidized to a slag Figure 14 shows a PSD for the Cu Fe S O system at 1 atm SO 2 as a function of temperature (Rosenqvist 1978)Unlike the system for lead,the copper and Cu 2 S melts are nearly immiscible.University of Minnesota’s Mineral Pages: ChalcopyriteHowever,chalcopyrite is much more abundant than the other copper bearing minerals and is far more widely distributed so it remains our most important copper source In many societies copper was the first known metal to be widely worked,and for over six thousand years copper mining has remained a,
