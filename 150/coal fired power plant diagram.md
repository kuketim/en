## How a Coal Plant Works
Our Power System ; Coal ; How a Coal Plant Works; How a Coal Plant Works.Coal fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam.The steam produced,under tremendous pressure,flows into a turbine,which spins a generator to create electricity.The steam is then cooled,condensed back into water and returned to the.Thermal power station WikipediaCurrently most of the nuclear power stations must operate below the temperatures and pressures that coal fired plants do,in order to provide more conservative safety margins within the systems that remove heat from the nuclear fuel rods,Typical diagram of a coal fired thermal power station 1 Cooling tower: 10 Steam control valve: 19.
