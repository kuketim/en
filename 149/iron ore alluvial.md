## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted.The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey,bright yellow,deep purple,to rusty red.The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4),hematite (Fe 2 O 3),goethite,limonite or siderite.Hematite is also known as &quot;natural ore&quot;.alluvial tin ore miningalluvial tin ore dressing line in russia.JXSC Mine Machinery Factory is a professional manufacturer of mining equipments since 1985,our advantages are the dressing equipments for Gold ore Tin ore Tungsten ore Iron ore Hematite ore Chrome ore,especially have much experiences at the alluvial gold sand gold washing plant.
