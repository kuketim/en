Waxes prepared from hydrogenated plant oils,such as palm and soybean,are used to render gypsum board resistant to water.Unlike petroleum derived waxes used for the same purpose,vegetable derived waxes are renewable and readily converted into forms such as emulsions or powder that facilitate incorporation into gypsum board manufacturing.How to Use Gypsum in Clay Soil DoItYourself.comGypsum is a natural mineral and that makes it a preferred treatment for organic garden soils.Because gypsum is easily pulverized it can be converted to a powder that mixes easily in other soils,even clay.Gypsum,unlike lime,is able to neutralize salts as well as acids in the soil,which means better soil balance and healthier plants.
