## Jaw Crusher
The gyratory crusher can,just like a jaw crusher,accept boulder sizes close to 1.5 m (for the largest equipment). This crusher can handle products with a Mohs hardness that is not necessarily less than 5. As is the case for jaw crushers,there is not any mutual sliding on grinding surfaces,but simply rolling of the nut on concaves.Liberty&#174; Jaw CrusherSuperior Industries' patent pending Liberty&#174; Jaw Crusher processes aggregates in stone,concrete,asphalt,and ore applications.Functioning as a primary crusher in mining and aggregate applications,the unit compresses material as it travels down the increasingly narrow angle between the crusher jaws.
