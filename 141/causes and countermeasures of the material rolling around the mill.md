## Bearing failure and its Causes and Countermeasures
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Flaking (Spalling) Four stages of Flaking.Fatigue is the result of shear stresses cyclically appearing immediately below the load carrying surface.After a time these stresses cause cracks which gradually extend up to the surface.As the rolling elements pass over the cracks fragments oThe Most Common Causes of Bearing Failure and the …2.5.Material defects and manufacturing errors The ultimate failure causes for a bearing are material defects and manufacturing errors.Rolling bearing failures due to manufacturing defects make up less than one percent of overall bearing failures around the world.
