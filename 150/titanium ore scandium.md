## Scandium
In 1869,Mendeleev noticed that there was a gap in atomic weights between calcium (40) and titanium (48) and predicted there was an undiscovered element of intermediate atomic weight.He forecast that its oxide would be X 2 O 3.It was discovered as scandium in 1879,by Lars Frederik Nilson of the University of Uppsala,Sweden.Eve Online Moon Goo Reactions Live Diagram© 2017 adir1.com © 2007 Alysii LLC © 2008 2017 hanns.io All Rights Reserved.No official affiliation or endorsement by CCP Games hf is stated or implied.EVE.
