## Why the ball to powder ratio (BPR) is insufficient for.
The ball to powder ratio (BPR) is a processing parameter that is frequently used in both mechanical (ball) milling and mechanical alloying.A number of recent studies provided the BPR as a principal milling parameter while neglecting other parameters,such the vial volume,the diameter and quantity of milling balls and the powder mass.AMIT 135: Lesson 8 Rod Mills Mining Mill Operator TrainingRods are placed parallel along the length of the rod mill.Rods are 150mm shorter than the mill length.Breakage occurs more from cascading than cateracting.The product size distribution is narrower than a ball mill but significantly coarser.Most are overflow discharge type.Length to diameter= 1.4 to 2.3.Mill length = 7 meters.

## Ball mill
Less wear takes place in rubber lined mills.The length of the mill is approximately equal to its diameter.The general idea behind the ball mill is an ancient one,but it was not until the industrial revolution and the invention of steam power that an effective ball milling machine could be built.It is reported to have been used for grinding.Ball MillsRod mills are frequently used as primary mills to produce suitable feed to the second grinding stage.Rod mills have usually a length diameter ratio of at least 1.4.Tube Mills.Tube mills are in principle to be considered as ball mills,the basic difference being that the length diameter ratio is greater (3—5).

The length to diameter ratio of cylindrical mills range from 1 to 1 through 3 to 1.When the L D ratio is 2 to 1 or greater,we refer to the mill as a Tube Mill.Trunnion overflow discharge A trunnion overflow mill has an open discharge end.Material flows through the trunnion as a result of the pulp gradient betweAMIT 135: Lesson 7 Ball Mills &amp; Circuits Mining Mill.A survey of Australian processing plants revealed a maximum ball mill diameter of 5.24 meters and length of 8.84 meters (Morrell,1996).Autogenous mills range up to 12 meters in diameter.The length to diameter ratios in the previous table are for normal applications.For primary grinding,the ratio could vary between 1:1and 1.8:1.

## Calculate and Select Ball Mill Ball Size for Optimum Grinding
In Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do.Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize “just in case”.Well,this saBall MillThe ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20
