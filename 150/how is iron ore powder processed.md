## Manufacturing Process of Copper
Virtually all sulfide type copper ores,including chalcocite (Cu 2 S),chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and covellite (CuS),are treated by smelting.After crushing the ore to a fine powder,it is concentrated by froth flotation,which requires mixing the powdered ore with reagents that …Iron Ore ArchivesIRON ORE INDUSTRY INFORMATION.Iron ore is the main source of primary iron required for the global iron and steel industries.It is essential to produce steel,which helps to create and maintain a strong industrial base.Iron ore mining methods vary by the type of ore being mined.

## Iron Ore
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;After World War II,most of the high grade ore in the United States had been mined out,and so taconite was turned to as a new source of iron.To process taconite,the ore is ground into a fine powder,the iron is separated from the waste rock by using strong magnets,and then the powdered iron concentrate is combined with bentonite clay and.What Is Iron Ore Sintering? (with pictures)2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Iron ore sintering is a type of powder metallurgy used to pre treat iron before using it in manufacturing applications.Sintering involves heating iron powder to partially,but not completely,melt the iron particles.The exact process used and additional elements involved vary,with some methods using gas or electricity in addition to heat.
