## How to Use a Water Level: 13 Steps (with Pictures)
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;To use a water level,get 50 to 100 feet of tubing with a 5 15 inch diameter.Next,attach 1 end of the tubing to the flat side of a stake and fill the other end of the tube with water until it sits 2 toPressure Transducer Basics: a PrimerPressure Transducer Basics A Primer.sometimes the other side has its own pressure connection and the device is called a differential pressure transducer.If the pressures and media allow you to,it is best to connect using a nylon tube of several feet (to provide a high impedance water channel).

## Ball Mill Design Power Calculation
The basic parameters used in ball mill design (power calculations),rod mill or any tumbling mill sizing are; material to be ground,characteristics,Bond Work Index,bulk density,specific density,desired mill tonnage capacity DTPH,operating % solids or pulp density,feed size as F80 and maximum ‘chunk size’,product size as P80 and maximum and finally the type of circuit …Optimization of mill performance by usingcould still be pumped out of the mill during a few rotations.The accuracy of the measurement could suffer from the procedure that is followed by the operator.Mill power Usually,plant operators use mill power readings as an indicator of ball filling degree and,often,try to keep it at the maximum level.
