## CiteSeerX — 00.4 SIEVE ANALYSIS OF AGGREGATES
CiteSeerX Document Details (Isaac Councill,Lee Giles,Pradeep Teregowda): Fractured aggregate is defined as aggregate particles which have one or more fractured faces.A face will be counted as fractured whenever one half or more of the projected area of the particle is comprised of a fractured face when viewed normal to the fractured face.
