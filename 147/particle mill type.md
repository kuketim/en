Of course,the answer is ultimately feed efficiency,producing the most milk,eggs,meat or fiber at the lowest possible cost.Particle sizw,mill type,and added fat influence flow.By selecting samples this way,both roller mill and hammer mill samples had similar particle size standard deviation (PSSD),ranging from 1.1 to 1.3.There was an interaction (P0.05) between particle size,added fat,and mill type.Increasing fat and decreasing particle size increased the angle of repose.

## Mill (grinding)
This type of mill uses the same principle as a VSI crusher.Tower mill.Tower mills,often called vertical mills,stirred mills or regrind mills,are a more efficient means of grinding material at smaller particle sizes,and can be used after ball mills in a grinding process.Air Jet MillAir Jet Mill.AIR JET MILL reduces the material size by using a high speed jet of compressed air to impact particles into each other.EMCO make PSI are designed to output particles below a certain size,while continue milling particles above that size,resulting in a narrow size dis

## Size reduction
1.Principles of milling bulk solids.Milling is the action of reducing the size of particles thanks to a mechanical action.The mechanical action is submitting the particles to a stress,under the stress,some cracks will appear and subsequently the particle will bParticle Size Distribution of Grinding Mill ProductsThe particle size distribution was observed after 20,40,60,80,100,150,200 and 300 ball mill revolutions.The energy input was calculated from the net torque (corrected for the torque for the empty mill) and the number of revolutions.
