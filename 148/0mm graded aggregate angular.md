## Effects of Aggregate Properties on Concrete Size,Grading
Effects of aggregate properties on Concrete like Grading of aggregates depends on the proportions of coarse and fine aggregate.If grading of aggregate is varied,it also changes cement paste content (cost economy),workability of the mix,density and porosity.It is an important factor and has a maximum influence on workability.Aggregates Engineering Flashcards Quizletround,sub rounded,sub angular,angular; affects workability of concrete mix and the compaction effort required.Degradation.Continuously graded aggregates.all sizes are present.Uniformly graded.includes predominantly one particle size.Open graded aggregate.

## Studies on Characterization of Pervious Concrete for.
This study presents the influence of fine aggregate and coarse aggregate quantities on the properties of pervious concrete.Materials used are OPC Type I,fine aggregate corresponding to grading II and four sizes of coarse aggregate namely,4.75 mm to 9 mm,9 mm to 12.5 mm,12.5 mm to 16 mm,16 mm to 19.5 mm.Mixes were prepared with the water cement ratio of 0.34,cement content of 400 kg m 3.Products Weber Materials Aggregate Materials Provider.Erosion and weathering render the stone round instead of angular.This shape is the principle difference between crushed stone and sand and gravel.About 44% of construction sand and gravel is used as concrete aggregates,25% for road base,and 13% as aggregate for asphalt.The remainder is used for base,fill and other applications.

3 Aggregate Properties.aggregate is highly absorptive,the aggregate continues to absorb asphalt,after initial mixing at the plant,until the mix coolspletely.This process leaves less asphalt for bonding purposes therefore,a more porous aggregate requires more asphalt than a less porous aggregate…MAMAHOME2018 2 16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Fine Aggregate: When the aggregate is sieved through 4.75mm sieve,the aggregate passed through it called as fine aggregate.Natural sand is generally used as fine aggregate,silt and clay are also come under this category.The soft deposit consisting of sand,silt and clay is termed as loam.
