and with the decreased grain size,the necessary ball size also decreases (Olejnik,2010; 2011).For each grain size there is an optimal ball size (Trumic et.al.2007).The bigger ball in relation to the optimal one will have an excess energy,and consequently,the smaller ball mill has less energy necessary for grinding.In bothOverflow VS Grate Discharge Ball or MillGrate Discharge Ball Mills have shown 25% to 45% more tonnage ground and a substantial reduction in power consumed per ton of material compared size for size with overflow mills.To illustrate the characteristics of various type mills we have shown the types of discharge for rod mills and ball mills.
