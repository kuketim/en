## Why use Fly Ash and Slag in Concrete?
With cement being the costliest ingredient,substituting fly ash or slag can help maintain a stronger mix at a lower cost.Fly ash and Slag will typically be 18% cheaper than Portland cement.When a mix includes 20% fly ash,this will provide savings of 3.5% in cost.The advantage of slag is its ability to substitute more of cement.Asia Cement(China) Holdings Corporation Product and.Given that slag,pozzolan and Portland fly ash cement have good resistance to acids,these three cement products are preferred in preparation of acid resistant mortar and concrete.Avoid using silicate or ordinary Portland cement in acid resistant projects.
