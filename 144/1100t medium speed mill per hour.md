## The cost of energy generated by wind power
The Cost of Energy Generated by Wind Power.The total cost per kWh produced (unit cost) is calculated by discounting and levelising investment and O&amp;M costs over the lifetime of the turbine,and then dividing them by the annual electricity production.The unit cost of generation is thus calculated as an average cost over the turbine’s lifetime.High Speed Steel Tool Steel O1 O1 Technical DataO1 Tool Steel.O1 Tool Steel is the original oil hardening,“non shrinking” tool steel that can be hardened to the Rockwell C 65 range from a low austenitizing temperature.O1 is a general purpose tool steel that is typically used in applications where alloy steels cannot provide sufficient hardness,strength,and wear resistance.
