## Iron ore
Iron ore is the unrefined substance utilized to formulate pig iron,which is one of the most important untreated materials to compose steel.98% of the hauled out iron ore is used to produce steel.Uncontaminated iron ore is almost nameless on the exterior of the Earth apart from the combination of Fe Ni alloys from meteorites and very atypical forms of unfathomable mantle xenoliths.Refractory solutions for ore processing Allied Mineral.Mineral Processing: Iron Ore Quality minerals come from quality ore dressing techniques.Since ore processing is a critical base for many metallurgical practices,Allied enhances it with refractories designed for maximum performance and precision installation.Let us help protect your equipment from

## Iron Ore Statistics and Information
Iron ore is a mineral substance which,when heated in the presence of a reductant,will yield metallic iron (Fe).It almost always consists of iron oxides,the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3).Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.Iron processingIron processing Iron processing Ores: Iron ores occur in igneous,metamorphic (transformed),or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments.Most are sedimentary,but many have been changed by weathering,and so their precise origin is difficult to determine.The most widely distributed iron bearing minerals are oxides,and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3),which is.
