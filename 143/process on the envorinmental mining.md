## How Coal Works Union of Concerned Scientists
 · If coal is high in sulfur or other impurities,it is washed with a water or chemical bath,removing up to 40 percent of inorganic sulfur in the coal.Not all coal is prepared using the same process.High sulfur coal commonly undergoes washing to meet environmental regulations,while low sulfur coal is often crushed and resized without being washed.Environmental Resources Encyclopedia2020511&ensp&#0183&enspEnvironmental resources An environmental resource is any material,service,or information from the environment that is valuable to society.This can refer to anything that people find useful in their environs,or surroundings.Food from plants and animals,wood for cooking,heating,and building,metals,coal,and oil are all environmental resources.
