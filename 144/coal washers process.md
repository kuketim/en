## Coal McLanahan
Feeders.Crushing.McLanahan specializes in a variety of crushing solutions to reduce ROM coal to a transportable and marketable top size.McLanahan crushers can take the coal producer through all stages of crushing process,from initial reduction in the primary stage to further reduction and refinement in the secondary and tertiary stages,all while minimizing the generation of dust and fines.Coal Washing Plant,Coal Washery,Coal Washing Beijing …Coal Washing Plants consist of several sub processing modules including raw coal preparation (crushing and screening station),pre discharge rejects (rom jig,dense medium vessel bath,rotary breaker),coal feeding and washing module (jigging or dense medium cyclones) as well as a dewatering module,coal handling module (conveyors,train truck loading station,stacker reclaimer).
