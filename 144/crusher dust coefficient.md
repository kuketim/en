The dust removal efficiency can reach above 99.9,and the dust emission can be controlled below 20mg Nm3.It can suppress high concentration dust below 100g Nm3.For advanced sealing measures,the air leakage coefficient is less than 2%.Another one to reduce great noiseUses of crusher dustCrusher dust is a common by product of mining and quarrying.Rather than being discarded as a waste material however,recycled crusher dust has many practical applications around the home and in construction.Using crusher dust in lieu of other materials can have resounding environmental and economical benefits.
