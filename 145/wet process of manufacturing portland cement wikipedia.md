## explain wet process of portland cement production
The wet process of cement manufacturing involves adding water to finely crushed raw material,such as limestone,clay or iron ore,in a proportion of 35 to 50 percent water to 50 to 65 percent raw material to make a slurry that is fed into a cement kiln,whereas no water is added in the dry process.Manufacture of CementCement kilns are used for the pyroprocessing stage of manufacture of Portland and other types of hydraulic cement,in which calcium carbonate reacts with silica bearing minerals to form a mixture of calcium silicates.Over a billion tonnes of cement are made per year,and cement kilns are the heart of this production process: their capacity.
