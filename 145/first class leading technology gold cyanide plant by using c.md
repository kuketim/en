## Gold plating
GOLD PLATING by Alfred M.Weisberg Technic inc.Providence,R.I.All types of gold and gold alloy electroplates are used for many different applications by many different industries; however,there are eight general classes that may be listed that include much of present day gold plating: Class A Decorative 24K gold flash ( 4 millionths of an in.),rack and barrel.CyanideA cyanide is a chemical compound that contains the group C≡N.This group,known as the cyano group,consists of a carbon atom triple bonded to a nitrogen atom.[1] In inorganic cyanides,the cyanide group is present as the anion CN−.Salts such as sodium cyanide and potassium cyanide are highly toxic.[2] Hydrocyanic acid,also known as.
