## Stirred Mills Ultrafine Grinding
Figure 10.1 shows the difference in energy efficiency between a laboratory ball mill and a stirred mill grinding a gold ore using 6 mm diameter alumina balls as media.At a fine grind size there is a clear advantage in energy consumption for a stirred mill over the tumbling mill.However,as the grind size coarsens,the difference in specific energy required to achieve the grind lessens.IsaMillThe IsaMill is a stirred medium grinding mill,in which the grinding medium and the ore being ground are stirred rather than being subjected to the tumbling action of older high throughput mills (such as ball mills and rod mills).Stirred mills often consist of stirrers mounted on a rotating shaft located along the central axis of the mill.
