## Dry Grinding VS Wet Grinding
The choice between wet and dry milling is,in general,unimportant in small scale milling but is a major technical problem when large scale milling in the metallurgical industries is involved.On purely mechanical grounds it is difficult to see any great difference in fundamental principles between wet and dry milling,since dry milling may be regarded as wet milling with a fluid …Towards a Better Understanding of Stirred Milling.Stirred mill technology dates back to 1928 where the idea to use “an agitator and spherical grinding media” was presented.The year 1948 saw the successful application of DuPont’s “sand mill” for pigment grinding.Subsequent years have l
