## Copper Flotation
Although basic porphyry copper flotation and metallurgy has remained virtually the same for many years,the processing equipment as well as design of the mills has continually been improved to increase production while reducing operating and maintenance costs.Also,considerable attention is paid to automatic sensing devices and automatic controls in order to assure maximum metallurgy and.World’s largest flotation cells improve copper and …The concentrator is divided into two parallel comminution flotation sections,so that five ball mills feed each flotation section.Both sections consist of three bulk copper and molybdenum rougher flotation lines,and the rougher concentrate is transferred to a regrinding stage.
