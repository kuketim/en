## Torsion of Shafts
Example Shear Stress and Angular Deflection in a Hollow Cylinder.A moment of 1000 Nm is acting on a hollow cylinder shaft with outer diameter 50 mm (0.05 m),inner diameter 30 mm (0.03 m) and length 1 m.The shaft is made in steel with modulus of rigidity 79 GPa (79 10 9 Pa).Maximum shear stress can be cGrinding MillThe mill load cells supply the charge mass.The load cell signals are compensated for pinion up thrusts [10].The set points for the mill load and the two pulp densities are given by level 3 controls.The points may also be set by neural method of analysis or fuzzy logic expert systems.
