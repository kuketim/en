## Carbonation of Stainless Steel Slag as a Process for CO2
This paper examines the main results of an accelerated carbonation treatment applied to different types and size fractions of stainless steel slag.The objectives of this work were essentially toA study of engineering properties of cement mortar …1.Introduction.Stainless steel slag is the byproduct of making stainless steel from scrap iron.Approximately one ton of stainless steel waste is generated when producing three tons of stainless steel.It is not only a crisis of quantity but also a crisis of toxic ingredients such as chromium,lead,nickel,and cadmium that could pose both occupational and environmental health threats,.
