## Dry Grinding VS Wet Grinding
The choice between wet and dry milling is,in general,unimportant in small scale milling but is a major technical problem when large scale milling in the metallurgical industries is involved.On purely mechanical grounds it is difficult to see any great difference in fundamental principles between wet and dry milling,since dry milling may be regarded as wet milling with a fluid having the.Ball MillThe High Energy Ball Mill E max and MM 500 were developed for grinding with the highest energy input.The innovative design of both,the mills and the grinding jars,allows for continuous grinding down to the nano range in the shortest amount of time with only minor warming effects.These ball mills are also suitable for mechano chemistry.

## Wet Ball Milling Vs Dry Ball Milling Orbis Machinery,LLC.
The power to drive a wet ball mill is said to be 30% lesser than that of a similar dry ball mill.Nature Of Materials In the production of some products both wet ball and dry ball milling processes are required.Ball MillsFor ball milling,there is an optimum speed where the centrifugal force at the top of the mill is just balanced by the force of gravity.This caused the balls to be lifted to the maximum height before they fall onto the balls below,thus imparting the most kinetic energy.In practice,the ball mill is run at just below this speed (70 80%).
