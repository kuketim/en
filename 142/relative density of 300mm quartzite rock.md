## Aggregate
high density aggregate.In addition,the relative density of the aggregate is used in calculating the absolute or solid volumes of materials in a concrete mix and thus the yield.The apparent relative density of aggregate generally varies between 2.5 and 3.0.Geology: The Density Of Quartz Diorite&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The density of a substance can be an important physical property to know.However,the density of a specific type of rock may not be a single number because rock composition varies with mineral content.Composition Quartz diorite is an intrusive igneous rock.

## What is the density of dunite
a bout 3.27 (most of the time 3.3 is considered) Dunite is composed predominantly of olivine.A volcanic rock of dunite composition would need to form from a lava magma of.MagnetiteMagnetite is a rock mineral and one of the main iron ores,with the chemical formula Fe3O4.It is one of the oxides of iron,and is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself.[5][6] It is the most magnetic of all the naturally occurring minerals on Earth.[5][7] Naturally magnetized.
