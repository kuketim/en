## Mining &amp; Milling
Metal Mining and Milling.Missouri’s mining industry provides nearly 9,800 jobs across the state.Metal mining has been vital to Southeast Missouri for more than 300 years.Today,Doe Run’s Southeast Missouri Mining &amp; Milling Division (SEMO) deploys modern equipment,data analytics and stringent safety procedures to deliver valuable products.The Mining &amp; Milling Process8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Milling.Uranium milling involves extracting uranium from mined ore.The ore is crushed into sand size particles and the uranium is leached out.The uranium then is precipitated out of the leaching solution and dewatered,dried,and packaged.Through the extraction process,uranium is concentrated into a product referred to as &quot;yellowcake.&quot;

The Mining Process.1.Mining open pit and underground.To define the ore from the waste rock,samples are taken and assayed.Assay results are used to mark out areas of ore and waste rock,which are mined separately.Some water from dewatering the mine,from the embankment underdrains and decant water from the tailings pond is recycled.Processing7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The tailings storage facility is located west of the mine and plays a key role in recycling water for use within the processing plant.Handling of concentrate: At the end of this process,the concentrates have a moisture content of around 13%,which reduces dust generation during handling.
