## Mineral Extraction
Mineral extraction (mining) and petroleum and gas production are major resource extraction activities that provide the raw materials to support our economic infrastructure.An enormous amount of pollution is generated from the extraction of natural resources from the environment.Effects of Ultrafine Desliming on Coal Flotation …The use of secondary desliming cyclones ahead of froth flotation cells to reject ultrafine ( 45 &#181;m) particles has become a popular option in the United States for preparing fine coal feeds for froth flotation circuits.In light of this popularity,several experimental studies have been performed at industrial plant sites to develop a better understanding.
