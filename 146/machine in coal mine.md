## Appendix E: Coal Mining and Processing Methods Coal.
In surface mining,the ground covering the coal seam (the overburden) is first removed to expose the coal seam for extraction.The elements of a surface mining operation are (1) topsoil removal and storage for later use,(2) drilling and blasting the strata overlying the coal seam,(3) loading and.Being A Mining Roof Bolter: What You Really DoThey operate underground loading machine to load coal,ore,or rock into shuttle or mine car or onto conveyors.Loading equipment may include power shovels,hoisting engines equipped with cable drawn scraper or scoop,or machines equipped with gathering arms and conveyor.
