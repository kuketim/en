## Crusher Discharge Area
Crusher Wikipedia.12 &#183; The Dodge jaw crusher has a variable feed area and a fixed discharge area which leads to choking of the crusher and hence is used only for laboratory purposes and not for heavy duty operations.10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The reason why the cone crusher has poor discharge quality 23 09:49:48 The cone crusher plays an important role in the secondary crushing.The cone crusher processing material can be formed at one time,and the cone crusher with poor discharge may need secondary processing,which is a waste of time and what causes it.The Main Technical Parameter of Rotor for Impact Crusher.19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Rotor is one of the main crushing parts for impact crusher,the kinetic energy is obtained from high speed rotation of rotor.the number of impact crushing of ore block in the hammer area increases,then the larger crushing ratio can be obtained.7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A sectional view of the single toggle type of jaw crusher is shown below.In one respect,the working principle and application of this machine is similar to the Dodge crushers; the movable jaw has its maximum movement at the top of the crushing chamber,and minimum movement at the discharge point.The motion is,however,a more complex one than the Dodge motion,being the resultant of the.

## Cone Crusher
Cone crusher capacity charts are developed for use as an application tool to properly utilize the machine's capabilities.The crusher is one component of the circuit.As such,its performance is in part dependent on the proper selection and operation of feeders,conveyors,screens,supporting structure,electric motorshydraulic discharge jaw crushersThe Blake type jaw crusher has a fixed feed area and a variable discharge area.Blake crushers are of two types single toggle and double toggle jaw crushers.In the single toggle jaw crushers,the swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft which leads to a much more compact design than that of the double toggle jaw crusher.
