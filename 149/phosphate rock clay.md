3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This hard rock phosphate was mined in a region extending from Alachua to Citrus counties.The mining of pebble phosphate began in 1888 in central Florida and in the 1960s in Hamilton County.Today phosphate mining occurs primarily in the central Florida area (Polk,Hillsborough,Manatee and Hardee counties).How phosphate is mined and processed21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;rock phosphate can become soluble (and available to plants) either by chemical weathering or through the actions of certain types of plants.The solubility also depends on rock type and the pH of the soil; phosphorus is most soluble when contained in sedimentary rocks as opposed to igneous rock,and when soil pH is between 5.5 and 7.2.
