## INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS OF BENTONITE by
23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Clay Water Mixtures Bentonite water mixtures are used for bonding,plasticizing,and suspend ing.This versatility is made possible chiefly by adjusting the quantities of the two components.A bonding agent must have certain adhesive properties,and these are developed when bentonite is mixed with only a small amount of water.Coal miningCoal preparation As explained above,during the formation of coal and subsequent geologic activities,a coal seam may acquire mineral matter,veins of clay,bands of rock,and igneous intrusions.In addition,during the process of mining,a portion of the roof and floor material may be taken along with the coal seam in order to create adequate working height for the equipment and miners.
