## The cement kiln Understanding Cement
Manufacturing the cement kiln Most Portland cement is made in a rotary kiln Basically,this is a long cylinder rotating about its axis once every minute or two,This is important for a several reasons: From an engineering viewpoint,cooling is necessary to prevent damage to clinker handling equipment such as conveyorsDry Process for Manufacturing of Cement ,In dry and semi dry processes for manufacturing of cement,the raw materials are crushed and fed in the correct proportions into a grinding mill,powder fed direct into kiln would not permit the air flow and exchange of heat necessary for the chemical reactions of formation of cement clinker,The fused mass turns fuses into balls of.
