## Flotation process for recovering feldspar from a feldspar,
The flotation process comprises the steps of (1) forming an aqueous suspension of a feldspar feed in the presence of a flotation reagent comprising an amine containing a C 8 C 50 aliphatic hydrocarbon chain and an alcohol containing a C 8 C 50 aliphatic hydrocarbon chain,preferably at a pH ranging from 13 to 30,(2) agitating the obtained suspension to produce a feldspar,flotation of feldspar reviewFlotation of quartz from quartz feldspar mixtures by the HF.1.Introduction Froth flotation is the selected method for the separation of quartz and feldspar.In the conventional process,feldspar is floated from quartz by using hydrofluoric acid (HF) as activator for the feldspar and a cationic collector (amine) at pH 2 3 (O’Meara,1939).
