## Study on Fluorine Bearing Iron Concentrate Pellets Added With Dolomite 《Iron …
The effect of MgO on the properties of fluorine bearing iron concentrate pellets was investigated.The results showed that the properties of green ball did not change evidently with the increasing of the content of MgO.When the content of MgO was increased from 0.83.The Making of Iron & Steel SEAISIIron ore,as mined,is a combination of iron with oxygen and various other unwanted substances,generally known as "gangue" The first metallurgical step is to reduce iron ore to metallic iron,a process which is mostly carried out in a blast furnace,using coke as both a fuel and reducing agent
