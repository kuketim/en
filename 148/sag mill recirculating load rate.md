## Circulating load calculation in grinding circuits
The adopted hydrocyclone flow split parameter was 83.74%.This indicates that 83.74% of the hydrocyclone feed returns to the mill as circulating load.Considering the new feed is equal to 482 t h,the calculated circulating load was equal to 2,482.33 t h,…Choosing a SAG Mill to Achieve Design PerformanceSAG mill itself and not on the test work program.Stated another way,money invested in a large SAG mill is an investment that can produce handsome returns if extra production is needed or simply to give the mine t

The coarse particles (known as &quot;oversize&quot;) are returned to the mill and form what is known as a &quot;recirculating load&quot; that takes up a significant portion of the capacity of the mill.The centrifugal action of the product separator results in only the fine particles leaving the mill and the recirculating load is eliminated.recirculating load formulaball mill circulating load formulas pdfMill Circuit Pump Manual Weir Minerals A typical SAG mill with a smaller conventional ball mill shown in the.literature on recirculating load of ball mill for

## Effect of circulating load and classification efficiency.
The effect of circulating load and classification efficiency on the performance of ball mill circuits is compared toFreeing up milling capacity in a SAG mill &amp; ball mill.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Where the SAG mill ball mill circuit is the bottleneck in the processing plant the pebble circuit can be a significant factor in limiting overall plant capacity.The pebble circuit recirculating load can be very significant (depending on the ore characteristics and SAG mill operating dynamics).

## Grinding Circuit
In SAG mill operation,the grinding rate passes through a minimum at a “critical size” (Chapter 5).However,since most hydrocyclone circuits operate in closed circuit,the recirculating load or ratio also needs to be included in Equation (13.48)Figure 13.23 at.
