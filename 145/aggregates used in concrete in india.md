## Aggregates
Aggregates are inert granular materials such as sand,gravel,or crushed stone that,along with water and portland cement,are an essential ingredient in concrete.For a good concrete mix,aggregates need to be clean,hard,strong particles free of absorbed chemicals or coatings of clay and other fine materials that could cause the deterioration of concrete.Recycled AggregateType B recycled aggregates should not be used in concrete with compressive strength classes&amp;gt;C30 37.Those limits on the replacement ratio reflect the effects of recycled aggregate on concrete that have been experimentally observed in past research studies.Indeed,the main technical problems evidenced when recycled aggregates are used depend.
