## Tailings
Tailings are the materials left over after the process of separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore.Tailings are distinct from overburden,which is the waste rock or other material that overlies an ore or mineral body and is displaced during mining without being processed.SAG Mill Liners BreakageOur goal of advanced liner design is to maximize total through put,and wear life as measured by Total kW Hours Ton vs.liner metal mass used in Tons kg over the liners life.Most mills are not optimized for the above and have
