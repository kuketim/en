## Barite Mineral Uses and Properties
Barite is the primary ore of barium,which is used to make a wide variety of barium compounds.Some of these are used for x ray shielding.Barite has the ability to block x ray and gamma ray emissions.Barite is used to make high density concrete to block x ray emissions in hospitals,power plants,and laboratories.Bioavailability of barium to plants and invertebrates in,2015 5 1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The present investigation was to appraise the degree of contamination and human risk assessment due to abandoned barite mine sit The study has shown varying trends of contamination by different elements based on two methods,Contamination index and Nemerow pollution index,while human health risk assessment indicated the health risk through.
