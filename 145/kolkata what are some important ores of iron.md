## Iron processing
Iron processing Iron processing Ores: Iron ores occur in igneous,metamorphic (transformed),or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments.Most are sedimentary,but many have been changed by weathering,and so their precise origin is difficult to determine.The most widely distributed iron bearing minerals are oxides,and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3),which is.Different Types of Iron OreIn contrast to most substances,you can also magnetize iron,making it useful in the creation of electric motors and generators.Finally,there certainly aren't any iron shortages to worry about.The Earth's crust is 5 percent iron,and in some areas,the element concentrates in ores that contain as much as 70 percent iron.
