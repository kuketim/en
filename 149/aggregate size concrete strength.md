## Strength
30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;To obtain high strength concrete,coarse aggregate size is usually held to a maximum size of 19 mm,but additional cement is required for the additional surface area.The fine aggregate can generally contain less material passing 300 um and 150 um sieve because of the higher cement content.The Role Of Aggregate On Concrete StrengthExcessive aggregate size will also make the concrete less workable.Chunks of aggregate may even end up protruding from the surface.As a general rule,your maximum aggregate size should never be greater than 1 3 the depth of the slab.As you can see,the aggregate you select plays a huge role in the performance of your concrete.

## The effect of maximum size of aggregate on concrete …
The effect of maximum size of aggregate on concrete strength.Q.Does the nominal maximum size of the aggregate affect the strength at a given cementitious material content? A.As the nominal maximum size of the aggregate is increased,the amount of water needed for the same workability is reduced.Effect of aggregate size on the restrained shrinkage of.12&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;strength and maximum aggregate grain size are inverse ratio with the help of the comprehensive test so the bigger aggregate causes weak concrete.The effect of the maximum aggregate grain size on the development of the crack is defined as; 1.When the crack runs into the aggregate,it travels around the aggregate on the same way.

## Effect of Aggregate Size on Strength Concrete.
If,however,the two mixes are designed for the same slump and workability,and with the same cement content,the mix with l inch aggregate is likely to be somewhat stronger,because its water cement ratio will be lower.However this increase in strength may not be significant because of other factors that affect strength.Influence of aggregate size on compressive strength …The aggregate size is an important factor influencing the compressive strength of pervious concrete.This work is focused on the study of the relationship among aggregate size,compressive strength,pore structure,cementitious paste thickness,and then understanding the influence of aggregate size on the compressive strength of pervious concrete.

Recycled concrete is created by breaking,removing,and crushing existing concrete to a preferred size.It is commonly used as a base layer for other construction materials.Recycled concrete can be used as aggregate in new concrete,particularly the coarse portion.AggregatesCrushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock,boulders,cobbles,or large size gravel.Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases,soil cement,and in new concrete.After harvesting,aggregate is processed: crushed,screened,and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation.
