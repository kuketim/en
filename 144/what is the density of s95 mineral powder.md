The densities of rocks and minerals are normally expressed as specific gravity,which is the density of the rock relative to the density of water.This isn't as complex as you may think because water's density is 1 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 g cm 3.Therefore.Mineral FillerJames G.Speight PhD,DSC,in Asphalt Materials Science and Technology,20169.3.1.2 Mineral Filler Mineral fillers consist of finely divided mineral matter such as rock dust,slag dust,hydrated lime,hydraulic cement,fly ash,loess (fragments of pre existing minerals and rock forming a predominantly silt sized sediment that is formed by the accumulation of wind blown dust),or other suitable.
