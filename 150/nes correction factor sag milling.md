## Modelling SAG milling power and specific energy …
For SAG mill design,this model could help by generating a correction factor over the power (kW).Two new SAG milling models are developed in this work,able to predict power or specific energy consumption,including the usual design variables such as mill.(PDF) Power based comminution calculations using AusgrindAG SAG milling circuits.Every approach discussed in this paper relies on the use of efficiency factors (directl y or indirect.The energy efficiency factor was determined using the method.
