## Pulverized Coal Injection (PCI) System for Blast Furnaces …
Pulverized Coal Injection (PCI) System for Blast Furnaces In the past,reactions within the blast furnace were stimulated by injecting heavy oil,as auxiliary fuel,along with the blasts and oxygen.The heavy oil was replaced by pulverized coal after the oil crisis.This.Coal Fly AshWhen pulverized coal is combusted in a wet bottom (or slag tap) furnace,as much as 50 percent of the ash is retained in the furnace,with the other 50 percent being entrained in the flue gas.In a cyclone furnace,where crushed coal is used as a fuel,70 to 80 percent of the ash is retained as boiler slag and only 20 to 30 percent leaves the furnace as dry ash in the flue gas.
