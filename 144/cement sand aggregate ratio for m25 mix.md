## M25 Grade Concrete Cement Sand Aggregate Water …
Toh hum yaha Water Cement Ratio ko consider kar lete hain 0.45 Top chaliye main apko Cement,Sand,Aggregate aur Water ki Quantity ko nikalna batata hu.Sab se pehle hum,M25 Grade Concrete ka jo Ratio hain uska summation nikal ke rakh lete hain.Concrete Mix Design Different Grades of Concrete2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;To make ease in understanding we are finding the Concrete mix design of M20 grade concrete.The Concrete mix ratio for M20 grade of concrete is 1:1.5:3 that mean 1 part of cement,1.5 part of sand (fine aggregate) and 3 parts of aggregate (crushed stone) in volume and then batched for mixing.To know the Concrete Mix Design follow below:

## how many cement use for 1cum concrete for 25Grade.
M25 mix has a ratio of 1 cement to 1 sand and 2 stone jelly.i.e 1:1:2.This means cement volume is half of stone jelly volume.To prepare 1cu.m of concrete we need 0.0 cu.m of jelly.So we need 0.9 2= 0.45 cu.m of sand.Calculate Cement Sand &amp; AggregateCalculate cement,sand,coarse aggregate and water to prepare M5,M7.5,M10,M15 and M20 ratio grade concrete in volume and weight.However,above concrete mix ratios may not be accurately followed in the construction site.This may be due to a few reasons.
