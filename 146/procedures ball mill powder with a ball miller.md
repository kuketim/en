## Ball mill
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.Ball MillingBall milling is suggested as a novel method for enhancing filler dispersion in different matrices that is environmentally and economically sustainable [85].It is a solid state mixing of powders,usually performed with ball mills,which enables intimate mixing of the constituents through repetitive plastic deformation.
