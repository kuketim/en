## Coccolithophore
The most abundant species of coccolithophore,Emiliania huxleyi,belongs to the order Isochrysidales and family No&#235;laerhabdaceae.It is found in temperate,subtropical,and tropical oceans.This makes E.huxleyi an important part of the planktonic base of a large proportion of marine food webs.Primitive Technology: Lime&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Carbon dioxide enters the lime putty as it dries causing it to turn back into calcium carbonate.The new calcium carbonate has then set,remaining solid and water resistant.
