## Cold Crushing Strength
The Cold Crushing Strength (CCS) represents the ability of a product to resist failure under compressive load at room temperature.It has an indirect relevance to refractory performance,and is used as one of the indicators of abrasion resistance.The higher the CCS of a material is the greater should be the resistance to abrasion.Refractories with high CCS are also expected to have higher.How do you calculate 150mmX150mmX150mm cube for …cube size of 150mmx150mmx150mm is already sufficient for the crushing strength of the machine.that concrete strength is more normally found by measuring &quot;cube strength&quot;,that is where the.
