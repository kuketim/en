## Cement grinding optimisation
The cement clinker grinding circuit reduces the feed from 80% passing size between 10 and 20 mm to 100% passing 90 Œºm.The size reduction takes place in a two compartment tube mill; the first compartment of the miRawmillA raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into &quot;rawmix&quot; during the manufacture of cement.Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln,which transforms it into clinker,which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement,and has a larg
