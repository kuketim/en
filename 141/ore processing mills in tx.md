Uranium mining in Arizona has taken place since 1918.Prior to the uranium boom of the late 1940s,uranium in Arizona was a byproduct of vanadium mining of the mineral carnotite.California.Uranium was discovered in 1954 in the Sierra Nevada of Kern County,along the Kern River about 30 miles (50 km) northeast of Bakersfield.Two mines,the Kergon mine and the Miracle mine,made small.ASARCO » MillingThe ore is ground into a fine powder by large rotating mills.The two types used in the Mission South Mill are called SAG (semi autogenous grinding) mills and ball mills.SAG mills use larger pieces of ore to break up the smaller pieces (autogenous — does it by itself).The larger pieces break down as well.
