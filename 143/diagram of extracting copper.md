## Copper Mining &amp; Extraction Process Flow Chart
18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This flowchart made of machinery icons explains or expresses in simple but clear terms the step of the Copper Mining and Copper Extraction Process.Starting from either open pit or underground mining and using a different relevant treatment method for oxide or sulphide copper mineral (ore).Having a quick look now at how porphyry ores are treated and the metals extracted.There are two main.Geology of Porphyry Copper Deposits4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Here let’s understand the geology of porphyries and iron oxide copper gold deposits or IOCG as they are known.These are somewhat the giants of the ore deposits world.As a mining interested learner,the geology of porphyry copper deposits is vital to your education.Now in the first Exploration Geology Course I discussed how because our current mining technology all the metals that we use.

## Extraction Of Copper Mining,Concentration,…
Copper Smelting means that the concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica),calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and air in a furnace.The major steps in the extraction of copper are.Copper in Chalcopyrite is reduced to copper sulfide.Just like in Blast Furnaces,calcium carbonate is added as a flux to create the slag.
