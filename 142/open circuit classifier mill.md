## closed open circuit classifier mill processing differences
&#183; The characteristic differences between open and closed circuit grinding systems were examined via the use of a continuous vibration ball mill and a blade type classifier.For the same median diameter of the product,the rate of powder production in the closed circuit is about 5% higher than that of the open circuit.What are the advantages of open circuit system and closed.But if unqualified materials should be reprocessed by classifying equipment and powder satisfied requirements can be final products,this case can be called closed circuit system.The advantages of open circuit system are simple process,easy operation and less infrastructure investment cost.
