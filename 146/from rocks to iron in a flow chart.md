## Difference Between Igneous Rocks and Metamorphic Rocks.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The key difference between igneous rocks and metamorphic rocks is that igneous rocks are the oldest rocks on earth,while metamorphic rocks are derivatives of igneous rocks and sedimentary rocks.Igneous rocks,sedimentary rocks,and metamorphic rocks are the major three rock types in the earth’s crust.Geologist made this classification based on the geological process that formed these rocks.Which conditions lead to a slower rate of weathering.When it comes to rock composition,some minerals resist weathering others don’t.For example,quartz weathers slowly while rocks with feldspar,calcite,and iron,weather more quickly.Another factors that influence weathering are surface area of the rocks (more surface are,more exposed,more weathering) and pollution which speeds up weathering.

## Everything You Need to Identify Rocks
To identify a rock,think like a geologist and examine its physical characteristics for clues.The following tips and tables contain characteristics that will help you identify the most common rocks on earth.Rock Identification Tips.First,decide whether your rock is igneous,sedimentary or metamorphic.Meteorite Identification: Have you found a space rock?Iron is heavy and most meteorites feel much heavier in the hand than an ordinary earth rock should.A softball sized iron meteorite will likely weigh five or six pounds,making it seem unnaturally dense.Imagine holding a steel ball bearing as big as a grapefruit and you'll get the idea.
