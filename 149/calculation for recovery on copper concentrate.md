## Flotation Circuit: Concentrate Grade and Recovery
The texture of particles within a flotation cell play a pivotal role in both mineral recovery,and the grade,in the flotation concentrate.Theoretical curves can be generated based on particle mineralogy and texture to indicate the maximum grade recovery possible for a given feed ore.Electrorefining of Copper21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Electrorefining of Copper 1.Electrorefining General Introduction In an electrorefining process,the anode is the impure metal and the impurities must be lost during the passage of the metal from the anode to the cathode during electrolysis,i.e.the electrode reactions are,at the anode: M → Mn+ + ne and at the cathode: Mn+ + ne → M
