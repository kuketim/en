## What Is Lean Concrete? Reference.com
Lean concrete is a mix where the amount of cement is lower than the amount of liquid present in the strata.This makes it ideal as a base layer where other kinds of concrete are placed on top.It is good for providing a flat bottom in uneven or dirt terrain.Concrete.Compressive Strength of Concrete &amp; Concrete Cubes …The capacity of concrete is reported in psi pounds per sq.inch in US units and in MPa mega pascals in SI units.This is usually called as the characteristic compressive strength of concrete fc fck.For normal field applications,the concrete strength can vary from.
