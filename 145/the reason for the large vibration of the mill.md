## Causes and characteristics of vertical mill vibration.
At present the vertical mill is the main equipment of cement raw material grinding.Vibration of vertical mill not only damages equipment,but also causes instability of roller lift and roller drop,which affects output.According to the author's experience,the reason and characteristic of vertical mill vibration …Minimizing Vibration Tendencies In Machining : Modern …There is a possibility for the initial vibration to be self sustaining (unstable) and build up,with the machine oscillating in one of its natural modes of vibration.To make the increased capability of modern cutting edges,the cutting tool materials available,powerful and stable machine tools,holding tools and cutting tools are required.
