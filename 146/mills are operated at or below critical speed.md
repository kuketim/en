## Mill Speed Control Using Programmable Logic Controllers
The paper handle a few topics from cement industry,such are: critical speed,mill speed control.If the peripheral speed of the mill is too great,it begins to act like a centrifuge and the balls do not fall back.Therefore,this application conceived a PID controller for control the mill speed,using Programmable Logic Controllers.Variables in Ball Mill Operation Paul O.Abbe&#174;Mill Speed is one variable that can often be easily changed with a variable frequency drive (VFD).The starting point for mill speed calculations is the critical speed.Critical speed (CS) is the speed at which th

## Variables in Ball Mill Operation Paul O.Abbe&#174;
Mill Speed is one variable that can often be easily changed with a variable frequency drive (VFD).The starting point for mill speed calculations is the critical speed.Critical speed (CS) is the speed at which the grinding media will centrifuge against the wall of the cylinder.Mill Speed Control Using Programmable Logic ControllersThe paper handle a few topics from cement industry,such are: critical speed,mill speed control.If the peripheral speed of the mill is too great,it begins to act like a centrifuge and the balls do not fall back.Therefore,this application conceived a PID controll
