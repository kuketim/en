## Tailings
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Tailings are the materials left over after the process of separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore.Tailings are distinct from overburden,which is the waste rock or other material that overlies an ore or mineral body and is displaced during mining without being processed.The extraction of minerals from ore can be done two ways: placer mining,which uses water.Mining Waste Treatment Technology …29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Technology Overview as part of a Web based Technical and Regulatory Guidance.Biochemical Reactors.1.Introduction Click Here to view case study table at the end of this document.Biochemical reactors (BCRs) treat mining influenced water (MIW) by using microorganisms to transform contaminants and to increase pH in the treated water.

## Mining
Mining Mining Underground mining: When any ore body lies a considerable distance below the surface,the amount of waste that has to be removed in order to uncover the ore through surface mining becomes prohibitive,and underground techniques must be considered.Counting against underground mining are the costs,which,for each ton of material mined,are much higher underground than on the.An experimental study of the influence of lithology on.Considering the influences of particle size of broken waste rocks and to realize a compromise between the mass of broken waste rocks and the simplicity of test,each group of the samples for the four types of waste rock was prepared by uniformly mixing particles in the mass ratio of 1 : 1 by particle size.
