## What Kinds of Metals Do Not Stick to Magnets? Sciencing
You probably know that magnets don't stick to nonmetal (diamagnetic) materials such as wood,plastic,glass,cotton and wool,but you may not know that magnets don't stick to all metals.In fact,most metals are not magnetic.The carbonate ore X CO 3 of a highly active metal X heavy,Since X C O 3 is a carbonate ore (heavy ore) and X is non magnetic,hydraulic washing is the most suitable method due to the difference in the densities of the metal carbonate and the impuriti Suggest corrections
