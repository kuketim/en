## Ball Milling
Ball milling should be considered as a potentially attractive solution for solvent free synthesis.21 Solvent free One pot process Tip of iceberg Reference Lance Frazer,Environmental health perspectives,2003,111,10 Belen Rodr&#237;guez,Adv.Synth.Catal.Pith Balls &amp; Static Electricity7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A pith ball is a very small,lightweight object that picks up electric charge quite well.A charged pith ball works well to show the Coulomb force between two charged objects.If a glass rod is rubbed with silk,the silk rubs some electrons off the rod.The rod thus becomes positively charged.
