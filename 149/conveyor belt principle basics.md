## What is a Belt Conveyor? materials handling definition
3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Belt conveyor systems consist of two or more pulleys (a.k.a.drums).An endless loop of carrying medium—the conveyor belt— rotates about them.To move the belt and the material it carries forward,one or both pulleys are powered.The powered pulley is called “drive pulley,” the unpowered one is known as “idler pulley.”3 Basic Conveyor Belt Tracking Rules To FollowConveyor belts are frequently blamed for belt tracking problems and in most cases this is unjustified.The failure cause is usually to be found in the installation itself and may be the result of poorly adjusted pulleys and rollers,incorrect application of belt tracking measures or faulty design.
