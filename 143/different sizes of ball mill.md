## Mill Speed
Mill Speed.No matter how large or small a mill,ball mill,ceramic lined mill,pebble mill,jar mill or laboratory jar rolling mill,its rotational speed is important to proper and efficient mill operation.Too low a speed and little energy isEffect of ball size and powder loading on the milling.The particle size reduction results from the complicated dynamic interaction of the balls with turbulent slurry during the ball mill process,imposing a difficulty in quantitative interpretation of the observed phenomena of: (1) the existence of the optimized ball size at a given rotation speed; and (2) the decreased optimum ball size with increased rotation speed (rpm).

Ball mills are normally operated at around 75% of critical speed,so a mill with diameter 5 metres will turn at around 14 rpm.The mill is usually divided into at least two chambers (although this depends upon feed input size mills including a roller press are mostly single chambered),allowing the use of different sizes of grinding media.Ball MillsWorking Principle &amp; Operation.The apparent difference in capacities between grinding mills (listed as being the same size) is due to the fact that there is no uniform method of designating the size of a mill,for example: a 5′ x 5′ Ball Mill has a working diameter of 5′ inside the liners and has 20 per cent more capacity than all other ball mills designated as 5′ x 5′ where the.
