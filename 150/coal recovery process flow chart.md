Petroleum refining processes are the chemical engineering processes and other facilities used in petroleum refineries (also referred to as oil refineries) to transform crude oil into useful products such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG),gasoline or petrol,kerosene,jet fuel,diesel oil and fuel oils.[1][2][3] Refineries are very large.2007 ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Applications (SI) Ch.25.2010 11 3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Coal mills require large power motors for the grinding process.These motors may have their own ventilation system,or the motor heat may be rejected directly to the surrounding space.The challenge for the ventilation system is to provide enough ventilation to remove heat without creating high air velocities that disturb accumulated dust.

## ITmk3 Process
2011 1 6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In this new ironmaking process,particles of iron ore and coal exist next to each other in each agglomerate.This is in contrast with the BF and.Fig.6 shows the process flow of granular ironmaking.The process comprises 1) agglomerating iron ore and coal (blue).(coal) Air Heat recovery.Typical Process Flow Diagram of IGCC plantAs shown in the process flow diagram,the coal is first slurried with water and fed to the first stage of the gasifier.Oxygen with a purity of 95% is provided from the Air Separation Unit (ASU) and the coal is partially combusted to maintain a temperature of 1370 &#176;C.
