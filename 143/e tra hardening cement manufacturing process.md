## 16 Different Types Of Cement
Extra rapid hardening cement is used in cold weather concreting,to set the cement fast.It is also used in situations when formwork is to be removed early.High alumina cement is obtained by melting bauxite during the manufacturing process of OPC.It has a high compressive strength and is more workable as compared to OPC.It attains high.What Is the Cement Manufacturing Process? (with pictures)&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The cement manufacturing process is completed when the cooled clinker is ground once again in a rotating finishing mill.A combination of gypsum and limestone will usually be added in small amounts to the heated cement during this last grinding step,and coloring agents can also be added here.
