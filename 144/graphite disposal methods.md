## Rapid analysis method for the determination of 14C.
14 C is one of the limiting radionuclides used in the categorization of radioactive graphite waste; this categorization is crucial in selecting the appropriate graphite treatment disposal method.We propose a rapid analysis method for 14 C specific activity determination in small graphite samples in the 1 100 μg range.The method applies an oxidation procedure to the sample,which extracts.CONTENTSMagnox graphite core decommissioning and disposal issues M.E.Pick Magnox South,Gloucester,United Kingdom Abstract.Graphite core dismantling and disposal will be a key issue for the decommissioning of the United Kingdom (UK) Magnox reactors.The
