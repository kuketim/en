Oct 14,2011&nbsp&#0183&#32The development of limestone mining activities in Katni,Madhya Pradesh becomes necessary to increase the depth of exploration to produce ore.Increase in the exploration depth means that mining pits were subjected to water inrush.A hydrological and a hydrogeological model for the Katni area have been developed using USGS flow code,MODFLOW 2000.Ultratech Cement mines limestone (and villagers) in,UTCL operates an 8200 TPD (Tonnes Per Day) plant,which is supported by captive limestone mines,and is spread over about 997355 hectar Mining depth is currently at 37 metres below ground level,and UTCL will continue to operate the mine until its lifetime when about 23148 million tonnes of mineable reserves are used up
