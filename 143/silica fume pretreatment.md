## Comparative Study of Water Leaching and Acid Leaching.
12&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In the case of water leaching pretreatment,leaching duration for 2.5 h could yield an amorphous silica with purity of 94% and render the silica amorphous at 900 C for 7 h.The RHA silica yielded by water leaching pretreatment presented a comparable enhancing effect to that of acid leaching on hydration and improved the strength of cement.Determination of isothermal unsaturated capillary flow in.ratio,use of silica fume and drying pretreatment were investigated.2.MATERIALS AND SAMPLE PREPARATION 2.1 Materials and mixture characteristics Eight different mortar mixtures were prepared.Test variables included water binder ratio (0.60,0.40 and 0.25),type of cement (an ASTM Type 1 cement and a commercial white cement) and the use of.
