## Charge Acceptance
The small charge acceptance (&lt;1 A Ah −1) means that lead acid batteries in applications with limited charge time like photovoltaic or automotive do not typically reach the full charge condition in normal operation (some application engineers define SoC = 100% as soon as charging current falls below a threshold but this does not correspond.Charge AcceptanceCharge Acceptance Charge acceptance is the ability of a battery to accept and store energy under given external parameters like time,temperature,state of charge,charging voltage or battery history.From: Lead Acid Batteries for Future Automobiles,2017Related
