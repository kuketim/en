## Processes and Procedures in the Extraction of Iron.
The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process.The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace.These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyeres.Surprising Things That Can Hurt Your KidneysSalt.In some people,too much salt can raise blood pressure and speed up kidney damage.It also may lead to kidney stones,which can cause nausea,severe pain,and trouble peeing.
