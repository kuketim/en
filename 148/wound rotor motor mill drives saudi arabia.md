## Wound rotor motor
A wound rotor motor is a type of induction motor where the rotor windings are connected through slip rings to external resistance.Adjusting the resistance allows control of the speed torque characteristic of the motor.Wound rotor motors can be started with low inrush current,by inserting high resistance into the rotor circuit; as the motor accelerates,tWhat is the average AC induction motor life expectancy.There are many factors that affect the life expectancy of an AC induction motor (or any electric motor).These factors can include input power problems,improper mechanical instal

Vacuum starters are offered in three classifications.They are NEMA rated devices up to 600 Vac,Special Purpose rated devices up to 1500 Vac and Mining rated devices rated up to 1500 Vac.Each device is tested to different standards to serve their market.Typical applications include full voltage control of three phase squirrel cage motors,primary control of low voltage wound rotor motors.How an electric car’s motor works&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;This then pulls the rotor into an endless chase,as if it were trying to catch up with the magnetic field without ever succeeding.By functioning in such a way,there is a discrepancy between the rotor’s speed and that of the magnetic field.This phenomenon,called a motor
