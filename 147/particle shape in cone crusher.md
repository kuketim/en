## Cone Crushers McLanahan
Cone Crushers.A Cone Crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel.Final sizing and reduction is determined by the closed side setting or the gap between the two crushing members at the lowest point.Crusher Type and Product ShapeFlaky chippings (do I use the right word?) for roofing felt is produced from shale type of rock material.If you crush this type of rock with a cone crusher,the shape of the particles is more “cubical” compared if you do the crushing with a hammer (impact) crusher.Impact crusher obviously produces better chips for the said purpose.
