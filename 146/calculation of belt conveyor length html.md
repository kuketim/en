## Calculation of Belt Length
&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Dear Mr.Mahmud,The belt conveyor length calculation for general situation is as below : Find out the length along conveying route.Simplistically,suppose you have a conveyor of 100 m horizontal centre to centre distance and if it 10 degree inclines from tail to head,then the conveyor length centre to centre along conveying route will be horizontal distance divided by cosine of angle.18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Belt Conveyors for Bulk Materials Practical Calculations (Metric and US Systems) Jurandir Primo,PE 2009.The calculation of the total tension is.conveyor length ft T z Tension to lift (or lower) the load kg lbs h sBelt Conveyors for Bulk Materials Calculations by CEMA 5.21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Belt Widths The belt widths are as follows: 18,24,30,36,42,48,54,60,72,84,and 96 inches.The width of the narrower belts may be governed by the size of lumps to be handled.Belts must be wide enough so that any combination of prevailing lumps and finer material does not load the lumps too close to the edge of the conveyor belt.11&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Working Principle of Conveyor Belt.Conveyor Belt is a machine taking the friction as the driving force to transport materials in a continuous way.The equipments consist of frame,conveyor belt,support,roller,tensioning device,driving device,etc.From the material charging point to the materials discharging point,it generates a material transport process on a certain transport line.
