When the tungsten carbide powder is mixed and ground with a metal bond to produce a certain grade of tungsten carbide powder,various combinations can be employed.The most commonly used cobalt content is 3% to 25% by weight,and nickel and chromium are required to increase the corrosion resistance of the tool.The kinetics and efficiency of batch ball grinding with …Grinding balls were selected as shown in Table 1 for these reasons: firstly,it was observed that only balls smaller than 40 mm may show significant effects of media on grinding kinetics in small laboratory mills (20 cm diameters or smaller); secondly,to mimic the charge motion in industrial mill,the ratio of mill cylinder’s diameter to maximum ball size should be at least 6,for instance.
