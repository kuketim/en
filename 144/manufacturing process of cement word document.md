## Cement
Cement powder,here conditioned in bag,is mixed with fine and coarse aggregates and water.Handling dry cement in this way without PPE breathing equipment (of at least P2 particle filtering [1]) is extremely hazardous to human health [2].A cement is a binder,a substance used for construction that sets,hardens,and adheres to other materials to bind them together.What Is the Cement Manufacturing Process? (with pictures)&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The cement manufacturing process is completed when the cooled clinker is ground once again in a rotating finishing mill.A combination of gypsum and limestone will usually be added in small amounts to the heated cement during this last grinding step,and coloring agents can also be added here.

## The Cement Manufacturing Process Advancing Mining
20 08 2015&#0183;&#32;Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay,to a fine powder,called raw meal,which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 &#176;C in a cement kiln In this process,the chemical bonds of the raw materials are broken down and then they are.
