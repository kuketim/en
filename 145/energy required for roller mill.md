## Size Reduction and Energy Requirement
The power or energy required is the sum of the work required to crush or grind the rock as well as to rotate the mill.The power required depends on the hardness of the rock,the initial size and the final product size required to achieve reasonable liberation of the mineral of interest,from the host rock.3.3.Cement grinding Vertical roller mills versus ball mills23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;grinding of raw materials.The grinding efficiency of the vertical roller mill combined with an ability to dry,grind and classify within a single unit gives the vertical roller mill a decided advantage over a ball mill system.However,despite these benefits,applications of the vertical roller mill for cement grinding are less prevalent.
