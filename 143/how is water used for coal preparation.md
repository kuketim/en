## Coal Use and the Environment WCA
While coal preparation is standard practice in many countries,greater uptake in developing countries is needed as a low cost way to improve the environmental performance of coal.Particulates Particulate emissions are finely divided solid and liquid (other than water) …Magnetite Recovery in Coal Washing by High Gradient …Fine magnetite mixed into a water suspension is commonly used in coal preparation to create a pseudo specific gravity great enough to effect separations between coal and associ ated impurities.The magnetite must not only be reclaimed but must also be cleaned to prevent coal and impurities from building up in the washing cir cuit.

## Coal Preparation
Coal preparation predated pulverized coal firing,particularly for stoker units where sizing has always been very important,particularly in the minimizing of fines.Predating the development of pulverized coal firing came the development of pulverizers used in the processing of minerals.coal utilization Volatile Matter & Chemistry BritannicaCoal utilization,combustion of coal or its conversion into useful solid,gaseous,and liquid products.By far the most important use of coal is in combustion,mainly to provide heat to the boilers of electric power plants.Metallurgical coke is the major product of coal conversion.In addition,techniques for gasifying and liquefying coal into fuels or into feedstocks for the chemical.

## Water is vital for life Coal is taking too much
• In coal mining,water is used in coal processing,handling and preparation; dust suppression; onsite facilities,irrigation,vehicle washing,etc.• Almost all water used in coal mines is consumed and cannot be re used.Estimated water use based on 2018 annual reviews is 653 litres per tonne,giving a total water use of 292,500 millionWater Use Terminology USGSmining water use water used for the extraction of naturally occurring minerals including solids (such as coal,sand,gravel,and other ores),liquids (such as crude petroleum),and gases (such as natural gas).Also includes uses associated with quarrying,milling and other preparations customarily done at the mine site,injection of water for.
