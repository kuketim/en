## Horizontal Milling,Vertical Milling
A milling machine is basically used for shaping,routing,boring,and drilling metals and other solid materials.Generally there are two categories of the milling machine which include the vertical type and the horizontal type.In order to optimize the capacity of the milling machine,it is essential to identify the appropriate milling machine type for specific tasks.Today,there are a number.Vertical Axis Wind Turbines vs Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;In the wind turbine business there are basically two types of turbines to choose from,vertical axis wind turbines and horizontal axis wind turbines.They both have their advantages and disadvantages and the purpose of this article is to help you choose the right system for your application.

## Milling (machining)
Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material by advancing a cutter into a workpiece.This may be done varying direction on one or several axes,cutter head speed,and pressure.Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines,on scales from small individual parts to large,heavy duty gang milling operations.UNIT 1 MILLING MillingMilling operation is distinguished from other machining operations on the basis of orientation between the tool axis and the feed direction,however,in other operations like drilling,turning,etc.the tool is fed in the direction parallel to axis of rotation.The cutting tool used in milling operation is called milling cutter,which consists of

## Vertical Machining
Vertical Machining,also known as milling,relies on rotary cutters to remove metal from a workpiece.Vertical machining occurs on a vertical machining center (VMC),which employs a spindle with a vertical orientation.With a vertically oriented spindle,tools stick straight down from the tool holder,and often cut across the top of a workpiece.
