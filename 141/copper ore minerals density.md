## Copper
Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu (from Latin: cuprum) and atomic number 29.It is a soft,malleable,and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity.A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish orange color.Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity,as a building material,and as a.Copper Geoscience AustraliaThe ore is then ground finely before the copper bearing sulfide minerals are concentrated by a flotation process which separates the grains of ore mineral from the waste material,or gangue.Depending on the type of copper bearing minerals in the ore and the treatment processes used,the concentrate typically contains between 25 and 30% copper,however may be as high as approximately 60% copper.
