## Procedure for extraction of brass,zinc oxide and copper …
The method of extraction of brass,zinc oxide and copper oxide from the slag brass foundry relates to the field of color hydrometallurgy and can be used for selective removal of toxins brass production,brass,zinc oxide,copper oxide and by products suitable forGraphene production techniquesA rapidly increasing list of graphene production techniques have been developed to enable graphene's use in commercial applications.Isolated 2D crystals cannot be grown via chemical synthesis beyond small sizes even in principle,because the rapid growth of phonon density with increasing lateral size forces 2D crystallites to bend into the third dimension.

## Solvometallurgical process for extraction of copper from …
Extraction of copper from sufidic ores,either by pyrometallurgy or hydrometallurgy,has various limitations.In this study,a solvometallurgical process for the extraction of copper from sulfidic ore minerals (chalcopyrite,bornite,chalcocite and digenite) was developed by using an organic lixiviant (FeCl 3 as oxidizing agent and ethylene glycol (EG) as organic solvent).Metallurgist &amp; Mineral Processing EngineerLeaching,often gold,is the process of extracting a soluble constituent from a solid by means of a solvent.In extractive metallurgy,of gold,it is the process of dissolving a certain mineral (or minerals) from an ore or a concentrate,or dissolving certain constituents from materials such as a calcines,mattes,scrap alloys,anodic slimes,etc.to achieve either one or two purposes.
