## Addition of pebbles to a ball mill to improve grinding.
The investigation has demonstrated that the grinding capacity of a mill is maintained when balls are replaced by pebbles,up to about 30% of the charge volume.The energy dissipation and the surface area for grinding are reduced as the pebble volume increases,and it rBall millThe ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials,and it is widely used in production lines for powders such as cement,silicates,refractory material,fertilizer,glass ceramics,etc.as well as for ore dressing of both ferrous and non ferrous metals.The ball mill can grind various ores and other materials either wet or dry.
