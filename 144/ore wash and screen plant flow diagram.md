## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview
ore pelletizing plant.The idea of rolling moist fine ore in a drum to form balls and then drying and firing it was first patented by A.G.Andersson in Sweden in 1912.Further development was performed to bring the idea to reality.In 1943,E.W.Davies and coSolid Liquid Extraction (( Leaching3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Solid Liquid Extraction ((Leaching )) Leaching: is the separation of a solute from solid mixture by dissolving it in a liquid phase.Leaching occurs in two steps: 1.Contacting solvent and solid to effect a transfer of a solute (leaching).2.The separation of the solution from the remaining solid (washing).
