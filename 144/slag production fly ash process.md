## Utilization of Waste Materials (GGBS+FLY ASH)
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;1.2.1 Fly ash: Fly ash is a by product of electric power generation that varies from source to source.This is one reason why Slag can be used in much larger amounts.Fly ash includes substantial amounts of silicon dioxide (SiO2) (both amorphous and crystalline),aluminium oxide (Al2O3) andProduction of lightweight aggregates from coal gasification.21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Production of Lightweight Aggregates from Coal Gasification Fly Ash and Slag M&#243;nica Aineto1,Anselmo Acosta1,Jes&#250;s M?

This article investigated the potential of fly ash (FA) blast furnace slag (BFS ) based geopolymer as a novel backfilling material.The effects of NaOH concentration and FA BFS mass ratio were explored through XRD,FTIR,and TG DTG analyses.The results indicated that the reaction products and strengths of geopolymer depended on the NaOH concentration and types of source materials.WHY USE FLY ASH AND SLAG IN CONCRETE?Slag is similar to fly ash in that it is finer than standard Portland cement and is also cheaper as it is a process byproduct.Slag is produced by the steel production industry.Slag happens when iron ore is melted.The molten iron sinks to the bottom,while the

## The basis of slag is limestone used as auxiliary material in …
Blast furnace slag is a combination of silica and other non ferrous components of iron ore,ash from coke used as a reducing material,and limestone auxiliary material.Because its specific gravity is less than that of pig iron,during the heating process the molten slag rises above the pig iron allowing it to be easily separated and recovered.Utilization of sewage sludge,oven slag and fly ash in clay …The process of very rapid cooling of molten slag yields both granular and amorphous (glassy) structure.Fly ash is a waste product of thermal plants.Fly ash’s accumulation near power plants or other facilities causes various environmental pollution problems.
