## Application of external circulation cement vertical.
this paper mainly introduces the equipment,process flow and application of KVM external circulation vertical grinding cement semi final grinding.The results show that whenCement mill ResidueRe: Cement mill Residue.Dear Mr Jatin,You have not mentioned circuit of your mill.I assume that it might be a closed circuit cement mill.Best possible way to reduce residue on 45micron is by increasing circulation factor across the mill.The other way is to decrese cut size of your dynamic separator by increasing cage rotor speed.
