## Coal gas boom in China holds climate change risks Iowa PBS
Central to the appeal of the coal to gas plan is that it moves polluting energy production far away from cities while also turning the country's vast coal reserves into more valuable natural gas.Yet scientists at Tsinghua University and Ford Motor Co.estimate the process emits between 36 and 82 percent more greenhouse gases than burning coal to produce electricity.Fossil FuelsFossil fuels (coal,oil,gas) have,and continue to,play a dominant role in global energy systems.Fossil energy was a fundamental driver of the Industrial Revolution,and the technological,social,economic and development progress which has followed.
