## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground.Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s,has been widely used to generate electricity.Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production.and for cement production.The public health impacts of surface coal miningThe current paper reviews published evidence on the public health impacts of surface coal mining.Particular attention is paid to recent evidence for a form of surface mining practiced in the United States,namely mountaintop removal mining.Studies from other parts.

## History of coal mining
Early coal extraction was small scale,the coal lying either on the surface,or very close to it.Typical methods for extraction included drift mining and bell pits.As well as drift mines,small scale shaft mining was used.This took the form of a bell pit,the extraction.Mountaintop removal miningMountaintop removal mining (MTR),also known as mountaintop mining (MTM),is a form of surface mining that involves the topographical alteration and or removal of a summit,hill,or ridge to access buried coal seams.The MTR process involves the removal of coal seams by first fully removing the overburden lying atop them,exposing the seams from above.
