## Leaching Pyrolusite Ore by Sulfur Dioxide
Reaction kinetics for leaching Pyrolusite ore (Mn content 25%,) by pure SO2gas is discussed.Based on determining the effects of temperature,ore particle size,flow ofSO2,liquid solid ratio,and stirring rate on manganese leaching rate,the kinetic equation isconcluded as follows:The experimental results show that the leaching process is controlled by the chemical reaction atthe mineral surface.ManganeseHistorically,manganese is named for pyrolusite and other black minerals from the region of Magnesia in Greece,which also gave its name to magnesium and the iron ore magnetite.By the mid th century,Swedish German chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele had used pyrolusite to produce chlorine.

## Manganese (Mn)
Manganese occurs principally as pyrolusite (MnO 2),braunite,(Mn 2+ Mn 3+ 6)(SiO 12),psilomelane (Ba,H 2 O) 2 Mn 5 O 10,and to a lesser extent as rhodochrosite (MnCO 3).The most important manganese ore is pyrolusite (MnO 2).Manganese is used also as …Manganese Mn (Element)Today,most manganese is still obtained from pyrolusite,although it is usually burned in a furnace with powdered aluminum or is treated with sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) to form manganese sulfate (MnSO 4),which is then electrolyzed.Jefferson Lab,U.S.Department of Energy.
