## The Chinese Iron Ore Deposits and Ore Production …
This chapter will give a general description on the Chinese iron ore deposits,supply and demand market,mineral processing and iron ore metallurgy technology.For years,the Chinese iron industry is highly dependent on the foreign mines due its quick development on economics.Iron Ore ScienceDirectMining of iron ore is a highly capital and energy intensive process.Life cycle assessment (LCA) of the mining and mineral processing of iron ore in Australia was carried out in this chapter using SimaPro LCA software as a case study.

The West Pilbara Iron Ore Project (WPIOP) is a large iron ore and infrastructure project proposed for the Pilbara region of Western Australia encompassing integrated mining,processing,railroad and port operations.Stage 1 of the integrated project is centred on multiple Channel Iron Deposits located 30 85km south west of Pannawonica.Iron mining in the United States10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Iron mining in the United States produced 42.5 million metric tons of iron ore in 2015,worth US$3.8 billion.Iron ore was the third highest value metal mined in the United States,after gold and copper.Iron ore was mined from nine active mines and three reclamation operations in Michigan,Minnesota,and Utah.Most of the iron ore was mined in northern Minnesota's Mesabi Range.
