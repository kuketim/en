## Aggregate Base Density Data Earthwork grading.
 · The (150 180) density data comes from a "Design and Control of Concrete Mixtures" book and appears to refer to the "particle" density of aggregate.However,since the aggregate is made up of particles,it is reasonable that the compacted density of the aggregate is between (150 180 lb ft^3).What is the Density of crushed stone2.7T m3 (+ 10%).The above answer is for solid rock,generally not crushed stone.Crushed stone of uniform size has a nominal density of 100 pounds per cubic foot (1.6 Metric Tons per cubic Meter).
