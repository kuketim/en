Cement superplasticizer interaction in concrete is a complex blend of chemical and physical mechanisms that are interdependent.The complicated nature of the problem prevents the development of simple solutions to address the field related issues of application of superplasticizers.Sulfate attack in concrete Understanding CementSulfate attack in concrete and mortar Sulfate attack can be 'external' or 'internal' External: due to penetration of sulfates in solution,in groundwater for example,into the concrete from outside Internal: due to a soluble source being incorporated into the concrete at the time of mixing,gypsum in the aggregate,for example External sulfate attack.

## What is the mechanism of action of redispersible …
After dry mixed mortar added with redispersible polymer powder is mixed with water,the modification of redispersible polymer powder on cement mortar is accomplished by redispersion of powder,hydration of cement and film formation of polymer.The film forming process of redispersible latex powder in mortar can be divided into three stages.Reaction mechanisms of concrete admixtures ScienceDirectConcrete admixtures are of interest within periods I and II Once the accelerated period is reached,no strong effects of admixtures on hydration kinetics can be expected The main purpose of concrete admixtures lies therefore in influencing the solvation process of cement hydration
