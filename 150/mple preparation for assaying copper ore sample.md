## Sampling for Assaying
Sampling is the most important procedure in arriving at the value of an ore.Improper sampling makes other procedures,including assaying,valueless,as the sample must truly represent the ore from which it is taken.Before sampling,clean fresh faces must be exposed in order to prevent the possibility of salting.Having taken a large representative sample by chiseling 3″ to 6″ wide and 1.COARSE GOLD SAMPLING AND ASSAYand assaying protocols.Snowden offers expertise in ore characterisation,sample mass optimisation,sample collection and assaying procedures,QA QC programmes,check sampling programmes,protocol audit and review,and training and mentoring.The large
