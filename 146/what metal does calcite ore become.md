## Application of Heavy Calcium Carbonate in Polyester …
With the European Union classifying barium sulfate into the scope of heavy metal detection,the use of barium sulfate in export powder coatings will be greatly restricted.The heavy calcium carbonate has a certain functionality after being ultra refined,so it has become the only choice to replace barium sulfate in powder coatings.An ore is a rock that contains enough of a mineral (metal compound) for the metal to be extracted from it.Most metals are extracted from an ore by reduction with carbon or by electrolysis.Asked.Siderite: The mineral Siderite information and picturesDolomite Lighter in weight,does not become attracted to magnetic fields when heated Difficult to distinguish by appearance alone Difficult to distinguish by appearance alone Calcite Lighter in weight
