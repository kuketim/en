## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of …Experimental evaluation of engine oil.Experimental evaluation of engine oil properties containing copper oxide nanoparticles as a nanoadditive.nanofluids are solid liquid mixtures which are earned from dispersing nanoparticles with sizes smaller than 100 nm inside.although the rate of precipitation in the sample which was made by the ball mill method was very less than.
