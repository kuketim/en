## Extraction of ZnO from zinc oxide ore by alkali roasting …
Zinc oxide ore was treated by roasting with NaOH.ZnO,SiO 2 and PbO reacted with alkali first and then went into solution after digestion.In this paper,orthogonal experiment.GalenaGalena is the main ore of lead,used since ancient times.Because of its somewhat low melting point,it was easy to liberate by smelting.It typically forms in low temperature sedimentary deposits.In some deposits the galena contains about 1 2% silver,a byproduct that far outweighs the main lead ore in …
