Before the cyanide process was introduced,although the assay value of the quartz at Martha Mine was reasonably high,gold recoveries were low.The first cyanidation plant in the world was established close to Waihi,at the Crown Mine at Karangahake,in 1889.By.Metallurgist &amp; Mineral Processing EngineerThus,the gold leach reaction can become cyanide limited if the CN concentration gets too low can compensate by having higher cyanide addition but also get higher HCN and hence HCN loss! Increase in oxygen reduction potential with decrease in pH may increase gold leach rate if the reaction is not diffusion limited; I'd however doubt this benefit would ever outweigh the HCN losses.

## Optimizing and evaluating the operational factors.
This research was carried out on Aghdareh gold ore.The Aghdareh mine and gold processing plant is located 32 km from Takab city in the western Azerbaijan province,Iran,at 46°58′30′′N and 36°39′29′′E.The grade of gold ore is 3 ppm.Also,cyanide leaching is used to process gold in the Aghdareh mine.The main problem in.How to Leach Gold Ore With Chlorination SciencingHow to Leach Gold Ore With Chlorination.The use of chlorine is both the cheapest and most plentiful method for leaching gold.When you mix sodium chloride and hydrochloric acid together,you produce a form of electrolysis that removes gold from rock and soil.The sodium metabisulphate lowers the pH of the solution,turning the gold.

## Gold Extraction
However,leaching of gold after 24 h at pH 8.5 was similar to that observed at higher pH value,but the leaching rate was considerably slower.Figure 28.4.Effect of pH on gold and silver extraction in selected oxide carbonaceous and sulfide ores (oxide and carbonaceous,Aylmore (unpublished); sulfide,Navarro et al.(2002) ).The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching An Introduction …Liberation: Cyanide leaching will only be effective if the cyanide can come in contact with the gold particle.For this to happen,the ore should either be sufficiently porous for cyanide to reach the gold,or more usually the ore is crushed and ground to a size at which the surface of the gold is exposed i.e.the gold is liberated.
