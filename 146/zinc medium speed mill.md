## Speeds and Feeds
Example 3: Calculate the speed and feed for a HSS countersink used to countersink a #10 clearance hole in aluminum using a manual milling machine.TIP: Countersinking should generally be performed at 25% of the speed and the same feed per …Mechanical platingMechanical plating,also known as peen plating,mechanical deposition,or impact plating,is a plating process that imparts the coating by cold welding fine metal particles to a workpiece.Mechanical galvanization is the same process,but applies to coatings that are thicker than 0.001 in (0.025 mm).It is commonly used to overcome hydrogen embrittlement problems.
