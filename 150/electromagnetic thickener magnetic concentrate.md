## Magnetic Shielding
As mentioned above,magnetic materials like iron concentrate the magnetic field lines and divert them out from the ends.Using this principle,these magnetic materials can act as magnetic shielding.Magnetic shielding is to prevent surrounding magnetic field lines from reaching the magnetic sensitive equipments (like MRI scanner) whose operation may be affected by the fields.Pulsed Magnetic Fields in Therapy Introduction and Backgroundreference).There are geomagnetic fields (related to the Earth's magnetic core) but we will concentrate on electromagnetic fields generated or applied as a therapy tool or device.An electric field is the region of space surrounding electrically charged particles (and
