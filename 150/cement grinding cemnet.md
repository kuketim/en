## Manufacturing process Lafarge
The cement manufacturing process starts from the mining of raw materials that are used in cement manufacturing,mainly limestone and clays.A limestone quarry is inside the plant area and a clays quarry is as far from the plant area as 25 km.Cement TypesWhat are the differences in these cement types and how are they tested,produced,and identified in practice? In the most general sense,portland cement is produced by heating sources of lime,iron,silica,and alumina to clinkering temperature (2,500 to 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit) in a rotating kiln,then grinding the clinker to a fine powder.

## Grinding systems
The ball mill is traditionally the basic technology in a cement plant and is a very reliable machine.It is particularly well adapted to the grinding of products at high fineness,very abrasive products and solid fuels,as well as to a wide range of minerals.Grinding trends in the cement industrySummary: The main trends concerning grinding processes in the cement industry are still higher efficiency,reduction of the power consumption and system simplicity.In the case of new orders,vertical mills have increased their share to over 60 % and ball mills have fallen to less than 30 %.

## Cement mill
A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage) is the equipment used to grind the hard,nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement.Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.Cement and its effect to the environment: A case study in SriLankaCement Company Ltd,(the only cement production facility that encompasses the entire production process) revealed that the production adopted the dry process,which includes supply of raw materials,clinker burning and grinding process.Further the study
