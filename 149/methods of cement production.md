## Cement Manufacturing Process
5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Stage of Cement Manufacture.There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process.Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction Quarry.The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium),sand and clay (silicon,aluminum,iron),shale,fly ash,mill scale and bauxite.The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.Manufacture of Portland Cement2020 3 2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The history of cement goes back into Roman Empire.The modern day cement.That is Portland cement was first produced by a British stone mason,Joseph Aspdin in 1824,who cooked cement in his kitchen.He heated a mixture of limestone and clay powder in his kitchen,and grind the mixture into powder creating cement,that hardens when mixed with.
