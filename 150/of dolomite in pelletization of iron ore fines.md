## And Pelletization Of Iron Ore Process
Iron Ore Pelletization is an agglomeration process of the disintegrated Iron Ore fines into Iron ore Pellet which is suitable for the utilization of downstream process of Iron Making The GPIL Process is the Ore ground to the required fineness through wet grinding process mainly by Ball Mills and the slurry is dewatered by pressure filtration.Iron ore pelletizing systemsIron ore fines are agglomerated into pellets and then indurated using a furnace to create iron ore pellets.These are typically fed to a blast furnace or DRI plant as part of the process to make steel.Metso is the only supplier in the world that has both the Straight Grate and the Grate Kiln process for pelletizing.
