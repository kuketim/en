## The Manufacture of Portland Cement
10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;IX Materials B Cement THE MANUFACTURE OF PORTLAND CEMENT Cement is the substance which holds concrete together,which means that it is extremely widely used in our society.It has been manufactured in New Zealand for more than 100 years,and during this century production has increased one hundred fold.7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A source and process sampling study was conducted at a dry process Portland Cement production plant.The study was performed to determine the nature of the formation of a highly visable plume related to the kiln emissions.One aspect of the study focused on the source or point of NH 3 within the production process.Global cement production top countries 2019 StatistaThis statistic shows the worldwide cement production,by major producing countries,from 2015 to 2019.In 2019,cement production in the United States amounted to some 89 million metric tons.Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC): Also referred to as grey cement or OPC,it is of much use in ordinary concrete construction.In the production of this type of cement in India,Iron (Fe2O3),Magnesium (MgO),Silica (SiO2),Alumina (AL2O3),and Sulphur trioxide (SO3) components are used.
