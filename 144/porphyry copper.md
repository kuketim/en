Porphyry Copper Deposits This text is based mostly on the Economic Geology Notes by Ron Morton and the review of porphyry copper deposits by Sillitoe (2010).Porphyry Copper Deposits Geology for InvestorsPorphyry copper deposits can also be associated with epithermal gold deposits formed by the same volcanic complex above the deeper seated porphyry.If alternation occurs in carbonate rich rocks,then unusual skarn mineralisation can also develop.

## Amarc Acquires Two Additional Porphyry Copper Projects And.
21 Nov 2016.Both properties represent significant potential for the discovery of porphyry copper gold and copper molybdenum deposits.Along with Amarc&#39;s&nbsp;.ASX ANNOUNCEMENT Porphyry Target Identified10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;the first quarter of 2014.Field and office work has enabled a conceptual porphyry copper target to be defined at Birdwood North.The target is a concealed pipe like porphyry copper deposit suggested to be at a depth &gt;300 metres below the peak copper (and molybdenum) anomaly and magnetic low anomaly (Figure 10).

## Porphyry Copper Deposit Model USGS
This report contains a revised descriptive model of porphyry copper deposits (PCDs),the world’s largest source (about 60 percent) and resource (about 65 percent) of copper and a major source of molybdenum,gold and silver.Despite relatively low grades (average 0.44 percent copper in 2008),PCDs.Porphyry Copper Systems Request PDF ResearchGatePorphyry copper deposits (PCDs) represent the most important type of Cu reservoir on Earth,but the mechanism of Cu enrichment in PCDs is debated due to the lack of direct constraints.

## How to make porphyry copper deposits
Porphyry copper deposits (PCDs) represent shallow level intrusions (2 5 km) in the crust.Mineralization of Cu ores tend to occur at the tops of porphyry systems in cupolas.Possible regimes where Cu may be mobilized include hydrothermal circulation at mid ocean ridge centers,dehydration or melting of the subducting slab,and late stage.What is a Porphyry Copper Deposit Arizona Geological Society11 Jan 2014.Over the last several years,many of you have probably heard the term “porphyry copper” and wondered what everyone is talking about.

## Porphyry
Porphyry Copper Gold and Intrusion Related Gold.Porphyry type deposits form in geological settings similar to those of epithermal deposits.The main difference with regard to preservation potential is that the former form at deeper levels of the crust,between 1 5 km below the surface.
