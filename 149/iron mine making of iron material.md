23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;agglomerated iron ores are iron ore pellets which are used as raw material for primary iron and steel making.The stand alone production of non agglomerated iron ores and concentrates is not covered by the EU ETS,since the amounts of emissions are too small.The production of iron ore pellets can be described as follows: Non agglomerated iron oresHow Iron and Steel WorkInstead,the iron heats up into a spongy mass containing iron and silicates from the ore.Heating and hammering this mass (called the bloom) forces impurities out and mixes the glassy silicates into the iron metal to create wrought iron.Wrought iron is hardy and easy to work,making it perfect for creating tools.
