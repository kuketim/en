## Boring (manufacturing)
The boring process can be executed on various machine tools,including (1) general purpose or universal machines,such as lathes ( turning centers) or milling machines ( machining centers),and (2) machines designed to specialize in boring as a primary function,such as jig borers and boring machines or boring mills,which include vertical boring mills (workpiece rotates around a vertical …Chapter 18.Feed Milling ProcessesThe mill consists of a rotating shaft with four attached parallel knives and a screen occupying one fourth of the 360 degree rotation.The mill is best used to crack whole grains with a minimum of &quot;fines&quot;.It is not used as a final process for reducing the size o

## Impact Crusher Working Principle
Starting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them.Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic.An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill).Turning &amp; the Lathe&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Turning on the lathe is one of the most common metalcutting operations.Lathes are particularly suited to machining relatively long,cylindrical workpieces,
