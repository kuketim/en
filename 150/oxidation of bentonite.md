PRODUCTION OF ELEMENTAL SULFUR AND BENTONITE CLAY.Biological oxidation of sulfur granules is a critical component in elemental sulfur fertilizers since it converts sulfur to plant available sulfate.The level of biological oxidation is,in turn,regulated by the size and surface area of the sulfur granules.The aim of this research was to produce coarse sulfur granules that disintegrate.Oxidation WineSkillsPost fermentation oxidation is one of the chief causes of loss of quality in white wines.When oxidised,the colour of wines change,becoming brown and cloudy.

to be lower than the limit of quantification of the methylene blue method,however,oxidation and or H 2 S loss,may have caused a lowering of the sulphide concentration in the samples,thus introducing an uncertainty.Sulphide was also added in some samples,and when sulphide was added as Na 2 S solution,the results indicated that the bentonite reduced the amount of sulphide in the solution.US4411530AA system and method for rapid beneficiation of bentonite clay is disclosed.Beneficiation of the bentonite clay occurs through oxidation of structural ferrous iron.For rapid beneficiation,bentonite clay,preferably ground,is subjected to moist air while the clay is being agitated,preferably by tumbling within a rotating drum,to provide rapid exchange of moisture and oxygen in the air with.
