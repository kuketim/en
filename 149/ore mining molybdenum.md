## Climax mine
20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The main ore bearing area was Bartlett Mountain,which was mined out during the early mining.The demand for molybdenum fell drastically at the end of World War I,and the Climax mine shut down in 1919.Molybdenum later found use in the metal alloys for the turbines of jet engines.Molybdenum Ore ReservesMolybdenum occurs in nature only in chemical combination with other elements.A number of molybdenum bearing minerals have been identified,but the only one of commercial significance is molybdenite (MoS 2) a natural molybdenum sulfide.In ore bodies,molybdenite is generally present in quantities from 0.0.25% and is often associated with the sulfide minerals of other metals,notably …
