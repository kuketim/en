## Gold extraction
Of all the methods of extracting gold &amp; processing it from its ore,I used a few to evaluate two principal flowsheets in this case study.The flowsheets utilized operations that involved flotation,cyanidation and gravity concentration.Tests that mirror each of these unit operations were utilized to evaluate the principal flowsheets.This page offers a comparative review of gold recovery.Gold processing Britannica.comGold processing,preparation of the ore for use in various products.Native gold is the most common mineral of gold,accounting for about 80 percent of the metal in the Earth’s crust.It occasionally is found as nuggets as large as 12 millimetres (0.5 inch) in diameter,and on rare occasions.

## How is gold mined?
How is gold mined? Gold is mined by 4 different methods.Placer mining,hard rock mining,byproduct mining and by processing gold ore.Each of these categories has it's own unique methods of extracting the gold from the surrounding materials.In placer mining,the gold is retrieved by metal detecting,panning,cradling,sluicing and dredging.Gold Extraction and Recovery ProcessesVarious methods such as gravity concentration,flotation,panning,pyrometallurgy,cyanidation etc are available for the extraction of gold metal from its ores.Amongst these methods,cyanidation is the most common method used in the leaching of gold from the ore.This process involves the dissolution of gold

## Extraction of Gold
The extraction of gold by the cyanide method is of great technical importance.It is effected by lixiviation with a solution of potassium cyanide,the gold being precipitated either by addition of zinc or electrolytically.The process was suggested by Mac Arthur and Forrest in 1385,and is based on the well known solubility of gold in potassium.Gold Extraction Mining Gold.infoExtraction of Gold by the Amalgam Process.The amalgam process is the oldest technical method of extracting gold and was used in antiquity.With the amalgam process the gold bearing rock is likewise crushed to fine sand.Afterwards mercury is added to the rock dust.Gold has the property that enables it to join to the surface of the mercury.
