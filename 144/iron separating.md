## Developments in the physical separation of iron ore.
As shown in Figure 9.2,when the iron ore slurry passes through the separating chute,magnetite particles from the slurry are attracted by magnetic forces to the surface of the drum,while gangue minerals are dragged down by gravity and water flow.These magnetic particles are then brought by the rotating drum to the top where the magnetic.MixturesMixtures.A mixture is made from different substances that are not chemically joined.For example,powdered iron and powdered sulfur mixed together make a mixture of iron and sulfur.

## Ethane ethylene separation in a metal organic framework …
Abstract The separation of ethane from its corresponding ethylene is an important,challenging,and energy intensive process in the chemical industry.Here we report a microporous metal organic framework,iron(III) peroxide 2,dioxido,benzenedicarboxylate [Fe 2 (O 2)(dobdc) (dobdc 4−: 2,dioxido,benzenedicarboxylate)],with iron (Fe) peroxo sites for the preferential binding of.Hydrocarbon Separations in a Metal Organic.The redox active metal organic framework Fe 2 (dobdc) (dobdc 4 : 2,dioxido,benzenedicarboxylate),also referred to as Fe MOF or CPO Fe,was selected for testing in separating olefin paraffin mixtures owing to its previously demonstrated ability to bind O 2 at the iron centers in a side on manner.
