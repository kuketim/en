## Ball Mills
D.Sumanth Kumar.H.M.Mahesh,in Synthesis of Inorganic Nanomaterials,20183.6.1.1 Ball Milling A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind and blend bulk material into QDs nanosize using different sized balls.The working principle is simple; impact and attrition size reduction take place as the ball drops from near the top of a rotating hollow cylindrical shell.Using Ball Mills to Extract Raw Gold from Ores.The ore is sent into a single cylinder hydraulic cone crusher for the secondary crushing.Thereafter,the gold ore is transferred to a multi cylinder hydraulic cone crusher,where the ore is crushed further into finer material.From there,the crushed gold ore is sent to a ball mill,evenly as it passes through a vibrating screen for grinding.

## Dry Grinding VS Wet Grinding
2020 2 28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;It appears,however,that the rate of ball and liner wear is greater in wet milling so the decision between wet and dry operation is,in cases where the choice is permitted,a matter of balancing the economic gain arising from reduced power demand and increased throughput against the increased cost of replacement of the ball charge and the mill.Ball MillsIn all ore dressing and milling Operations,including flotation,cyanidation,gravity concentration,and amalgamation,the Working Principle is to crush and grind,often with rob mill &amp; ball mills,the ore in order to liberate the minerals.In the chemical and process.
