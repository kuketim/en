## Sinter plant
Sinter plants agglomerate iron ore fines (dust) with other fine materials at high temperature,to create a product that can be used in a blast furnace.The final product,a sinter,is a small,irregular nodule of iron mixed with small amounts of other minerals.The process,called sintering,causes the constituent materials to fuse to make a.Iron ore mining and dressingIron does not occur in nature as a pure substance but as a compound in rocks,which can contain up to 50 % iron.These ferrous rocks are also called iron ores.The iron compounds contained therein are mainly iron oxides,but also iron carbonates or.The most
