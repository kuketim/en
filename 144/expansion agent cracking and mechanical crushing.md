4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;How does Chemical Demolition Work? Chemical demolition does not entail big explosions and sticks of dynamite.It is a process that relies upon expansive grout that is drilled into strategic areas of the concrete or rock to be removed.As the chemical agent goes to work,it expands,creating cracks and fissures in the mass.Expansive AgentExpansive Agent directory Expansive Agent manufacturers,suppliers Expansive Agent buyers,importers,wholesalers,distributors High Expansion Foam Extinguishing Agent (Model YEGZ3,YEGZ6,HEF3,HEF6) The High Expansion Foam Extinguishing Agent exhibits high and medium expansion properties and is adaptable to use in various high or medium expansion foam generators.
