## Minerals &amp; Mining
Description: Whether steel and aluminium for vehicle manufacture,cement for construction,industrial minerals in aggregates,coal as energy,or pigments for colourful living mineral raw materials have countless applications in our world.They provide the crucial.Magnetic SeparationMagnetic separation takes advantage of the differences in magnetic properties of minerals.Most minerals fall into one of these categories: ferromagnetic,paramagnetic,and diamagnetic.Among these categories,ferromagnetic materials show the highest magnetic susceptibility,hence they can be easily separated by the magnetic separation method.
