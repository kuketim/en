## Rolling Objects Down a Ramp
roll down an inclined plane faster than lighter rolling objects.Our results may have been attributed mostly to the fact that heavier objects are more resistant to air resistance.In addition,because the ramp was made out of steel,having a higher mass could haveBowling Ball Surface FrictionBowling Ball Surface Friction The less friction a bowling ball has,the faster it moves.The more friction a ball has,the slower it travels down the lane.Friction is affected by several factors including the ball's shape,by it's weight,and the it's surface texture.All of these factors affect friction when your ball is in contact with the lane.

## Does A Ball Roll Further On Concrete Or On Grass?
Answer (1 of 4): It'll roll a lot further on concrete than grass because there is less resistance.I think it will roll further on concrete because the grass has dirt,and the dirt might stop the ball and the concrete is soft and without something that can stop the ball.Billiards and Pool Table FAQs Colorado State UniversityA "fast" cloth offer very little resistance to rolling,so the balls roll much farther before coming to rest,Also see the ball surface treatment resource page,because reducing CB friction has the same effects as a slick cloth,Two things you don't want to see happen to your cloth regardless of it's type,are stretching and breaking.

## If balls of different weights freefall at the same rate,
If balls of different weights freefall at the same rate,why then does a heavier ball roll down a hill faster than a lighter ball? Update Cancel,practically speaking,friction (wind and surface) and interior dynamics,or whatever other forces might be in play (how would I know,as you’ve provided no abstract for your “experiments”.Why do heavier objects fall faster on hills but not in,Why do heavier objects fall faster on hills but not in straight drops?,(so a "big" ball will roll more slowly than a "little" ball see for example this,Even if the types of mass were different it would not matter in this example because in both cases one type of mass occurs on one side of the equation of motion and the other type of.
