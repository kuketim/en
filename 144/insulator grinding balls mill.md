## industrial ball grinding mill how it works
industrial ball grinding mill how it works The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media the length of the cylindrical shell is usually times the shell diameter figure the feed can be dry,with less than moisture to minimize ball coating,orCeramic Media for Grinding and PolishingA ball mill is a method for grinding where small balls or beads are placed in a rotating drum.The media to be grinded is inserted and the balls will be lifted and dropped by the rotating motion of the drum.As the grinding balls fall,they break up the substance to be ground.The process can be used for wet or dry grinding.Ball mill grinding has multiple uses including cement,paint pigments.
