Extraction of Silver by cyanide process and its uses.Silver also occurs both in combined state as well as in free state.The important ores of silver are: Argentite (Ag 2 S),Copper …Copper mining.From ore to copper. SchoolScience.co.ukThe copper is recovered by electrolytic refining.Advantages of this process are: much less energy is use than in traditional mining no waste gases are given off it can be used on ores with as little as 0.1% copper for this reason,leaching extraction is growing in importance.
