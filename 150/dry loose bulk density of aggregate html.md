## What is bulk density of cement,aggregate,sand?
* The bulk density is the mass of the material related to a specific volume and for cement is normally expressed as “kilograms per cubic metre”.* The bulk density reflects the volume taken up by the cement plus any air trapped between the p.Density of Aggregate8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Density is an important parameter for aggregate.For aggregates,density is determined by multiplying the relative density (specific gravity) of the aggregate times the density of water.The bulk density or unit weight of an aggregate is the mass or weight of the aggregate that required to fill a container of a specified unit volume.
