SAG is an acronym for semi autogenous grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter,powered by a 28 MW (38,000 HP) motor.Frozen charge detection and automatic loosening with.low charge levels with small amounts of frozen charge.Figure 3 provides the actual values of speed,torque and mill angle for a Frozen Charge trip at a large SAG mill for reference.The speed is following the preset speed ramp until the trip shuts of the motor and lets the mill

## Used Mining Equipment SAG Mills
We have 44 years experience designing,manufacturing,installing and commissioning SAG and Ball Mill grinding equipment.We have nearly 30 years experience procuring and re applying used grinding equipment to new mining projects,often with significant lead time and capital coMill power draw modelsSAG mill models.Austin SAG model (hybrid phenomenological and empirical model).the models predict what power the mill charge geometry could draw assuming the motor can provide it.You must manually check the motor's tent diagram to confirm that the predicted power draw is actually within the motor's capability at the indicated speed.

## Choosing a SAG Mill to Achieve Design Performance
SAG mill is an investment that can produce handsome returns if extra production is needed or simply to give the mine the option to mill the hardest ores at design throughput rat Typical tests required to define a hardness variability function,are given below in Figure 1Advances in Discrete Element Method Application to.Advances in Discrete Element Method Application to Grinding Mills 119 to 2D non spherical to 3D slice to 3D full (Cleary et al.2003) the prediction of shoul der angle,toe angle,power and vortex cen ter increasingly improved.Obviously,these findings point in the direction of 3D DEM for full scale charge motion plus breakage studies.

## Development of a method to measure charges in tumbling mills
The charge level of a mill can be described as the volume occupied by the grinding media (including empty spaces) as a fraction of the total volume available inside the equipment.Assuming this definition,other measurements may be taken considering the total charge that includes the rock charge; in this case,applicable to SAG and AG mills.(PDF) A comparison of wear rates of ball mill grinding mediaA comparison of wear rates of ball mill grinding media.pdf.A comparison of wear rates of ball mi
