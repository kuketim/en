Abstract: Based on the research on the grinding media motion in the ball mill,the discrete equation of grinding media motion about ball mill is established and the motion regimes of grinding media is simulated using the discrete element method (DAnalysis of ball mill grinding operation using mill power.Analysis of a large amount of batch ball mill grinding data available in the literature has shown that the values of the power specific absolute rate of grinding of the topmost size fraction,S *,and the power specific absolute rate of production of −100 mesh fines,F *,are not independent of the mill operating conditions and mill diameter.
