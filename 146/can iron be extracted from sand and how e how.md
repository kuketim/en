## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? Reference.com
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining.The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however,because iron does not occur naturally,it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.Area Impianti can leverage many years of experience in the filtration of the flue gas emitted by aluminium and cast iron foundries.Through this strengthened infrastructure,Area Impianti can deliver co ordinated solutions both for small scale operations on the domestic market and for major international projects.Cast iron: cold and hot blast cupola,electric furnaces,sand,ladle …Silicon From Sand Educational InnovationsGCSE Chemistry revision section covering useful products from metal ores and rocks,revision video.How each metal is extracted depends on how reactive it is.Zinc blocks can be attached to iron objects.As zinc is more reactive than iron it will corrode preferentially thus preventing the iron from corroding. Part of the iron mineral phases contained in silica sand can be dissolved at temperatures higher than 90,while they are practically insoluble at lower tempera tures.Therefore,at temperatures around 100,the maximum iron extraction that can be achieved increases to 40%.
