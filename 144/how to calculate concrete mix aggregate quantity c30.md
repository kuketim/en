## Different Types &amp; Sizes of Aggregate for Concrete.
Typically the most common size of aggregate used in construction is 20mm.A larger size,40mm,is more common in mass concrete.Larger aggregate diameters reduce the quantity of cement and water needed because of its lower Voids.When the aggregate is sieved through 4.75mm sieve,the aggregate retained is called coarse aggregate.How much Ballast do I need to mix concrete? …Concrete Mixing Ratios When asking the question ‘how much ballast do i need to mix concrete?’ the answer is based on the strength of concrete you are going to need.Concrete is made up by a ratio of mixed cement,sand and aggregates gravel,a combition of the latter often known as ‘Ballast’.
