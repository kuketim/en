## Gold Extraction Overview
Gold Extraction Overview Auriferous deposits worldwide are present into three types: vein deposit (5%),placer (70%) and associated gold deposit (25%).The early gold exploitation focused on placer and later turned to vein deposit,which now accounts for 65% of total gold production.Gold cyanidationGold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low grade ore by converting the gold to a water soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction.
