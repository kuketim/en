## Cement
Portland cement,the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete,mortar,stucco,and non speciality grout,was developed in England in the mid 19th century,and usually originates from limestone.James Frost produced what he called &quot;British cement&quot; in a similar manner around the same time,but did not obtain a patent until 1822.What is dry process in cement manufacturing?In dry process for manufacturing of cement,the raw materials are dried and reduced in size to a fine powder in to grinding mill.The dry powder is called the raw meal.The raw meal is pumped into a blending silo.The raw meal is blended by passin.
