In the present work,based on linear discriminant analysis and principal component analysis,the aroma of dry and wet samples of different Xi‐hu Longjing and Pu‐erh teas were tested and differentiated by electronic noses (e‐nose).This is a tutorial on how to prepare the grinding tools and disperse pigments into water to make your own water based paint.This technique can be used to prepare dispersions of pigment in water to be mixed with gum arabic solution for watercolors,egg yolk for egg tempera,casein solution for casein paint,animal glue for distemper and for use in fresco painting.Grinding and Polishing24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Grinding and Polishing GRINDING removes saw marks and levels and cleans the specimen surface.Polishing removes the artifacts of grinding but very little stock.Grinding uses ﬁxed abrasives—the abrasive particles are bonded to the paper or platen—for fast stock removal.Polishing uses free abrasives onIn some cases,the paint job may hold up fine for many years,leading you to wonder why nearly all paint manufacturers firmly insist that washing the walls is a critical part of painting prep.Further adding to the confusion is the fact that paint manufacturers themselves don't agree on just what kind of …
