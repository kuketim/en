E waste precious metal refining system is designed to refine and recover precious metals like gold,silver,palladium(Pd) and platinum(Pt) from electronic waste (e waste) like circuit boards,including CPU,RAM,pins,and other computer components.E waste is classified as hazardous material therefore should be managed properly.However,the presence of precious metals (PMs) in e waste such as.HydrometallurgyHydrometallurgy refers to the application of aqueous solutions for metal recovery from ores,and has been practiced for copper recovery for many years.The original impetus for solution methods for copper extraction before the development of froth flotation technology was the existence of large ore bodies of low copper content which were uneconomic to work using conventional smelting methods.
