## Strength of Concrete vs Grades of Cement
To design a concrete mix of the desired strength with available materials,the strength of cement is required at 7 days (IRC: 2008) 4 or at 28 days (IS: 1982) 5.Based on the strength values of cement,w c ratio is directly read from the available charts given in IRC &amp; IS.Predicting 28 Days Compressive Strength of Concrete from,This strength gain in 7 day was higher than that for the conventional concrete where 7 day strength is usually about 65 70% of the 28 day compressive strength [47]

## Assessing concrete strength and the use of,
Concrete strength is typically taken as the compressive strength of a group of standard cubes at 28 days that are representative of one concrete mix of which not more than 5 per cent of test results are expected to fall28 Days Strength of Concrete in 15 Minutes Civil,28 Days Strength of Concrete in 15 Minutes,On testing the cubes of this mix at 28 days,the strength was obtained as 215 N mm 2 Conclusion From this simple method of analysis of fresh concrete,every batch of concrete mix may be predicted for 28 days strength just after discharge from the mixer,and any doubtful concrete mix may be.

## Rate of Strength Gain of Concrete Concrete Strength,
Rate of strength gain of concrete: To determine the rate of gain of strength of concrete,there is a need to select period shorter than 28 day,as 28 day is considered to be the reference time In concrete practice,it is accepted that after 28 days concrete usually gains most of its strengthRelation Between The Cubic And Cylindrical Strength Of …Conservative estimates put concrete cylinders at 80% of concrete cubes,for high strength concrete some say the percentage is near 100%.The ratio between the cube(150mm) and cylindrical sample(150&#215;300 mm).Generally Strength of Cylinder sample= 0.8 x
