The problem discussed in this antimony process study is limited to a concentrator capable of beneficiating 150 tons per day of antimony oreThe antimony in this study occurs as the mineral stibnite (Sb2S3) in association with small amounts of pyrite,arsenopyrite,galena and lead sulfantimonid The gangue is composed largely of quartz but contains,in addition,a small amount of talc(2 points each) Balance the following equations:Heating an ore of antimony (Sb2S3) in the presence of iron produces the element antimony and iron (II) sulfide: Sb2S3(s) + 3Fe(s) → 2Sb(s) + 3FeS(s) Determine the theoretical yield of Sb produced when 15.0g of Sb2S3 reacts.Determine the percent yield if 10.
