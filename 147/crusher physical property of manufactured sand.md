## Is there a business case for crushed sand?
According to Onnela,making a business case is largely dependent on how the industry can develop and tailor the technical properties of crushed sand for different applications.It’s also a lot about educating and convincing stakeholders about the good qualities of crushed sand so that it becomes acceptable and widely adopted.Manufactured Sand vs.Natural SandThe choice of fine aggregate,whether it is manufactured or natural sand,can greatly impact the fresh concrete properties of a mixture such as the workability,pumpability,and finishability.Natural sand has an ideal shape for use as fine aggregate in concrete.The natural sand particles are well rounded and are usually nearly spherical.
