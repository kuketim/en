## Science questions: Acid + Carbonate = what reaction? …
J.A.Lola,I think the question you are asking is how can you tell when a chemical reaction takes place.This is not always easy,because many reactions take place but do not show any visible signs of them happening.However,in the case of hydrochloric acid and calcium carbonate,the reaction is easy to see because the calcium carbonate starts to fizz and release a gas (carbon.Titration of Sodium Carbonate With Hydrochloric Acid.When you add a hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution to a solution of sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3),the hydrogen ion in HCl switches places with one of the sodium ions in Na 2 CO 3 to produce sodium hydrogencarbonate,also known as sodium bicarbonate (baking soda),and sodium chloride (salt).
