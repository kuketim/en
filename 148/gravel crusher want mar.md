## How Does a Rock Crusher Work? Sciencing
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;A rock crusher is a device used to crush rocks into smaller pieces,usually for gravel or some other road or building application.Most rock crushers have a hopper at the top a container which holds the rock above the crusher and uses gravity to feed it in.Alternately,rock crushers can use a belt drive to continuously transport the rock into the crusher.Crushed Stone or Crushed Concrete&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;A hole plus wet soil would spell moisture in your slab.So believe me,you don't want moist soil right below your vapor barrier.Hence your stone layer breaks the capillary flow of water water can not rise through the stone,and hence can't approach your slab.And here we have the important difference between crushed stone and crushed concrete.
