## Beginners guide to aquarium water hardness (GH)
It’s quite possible for your tap water to have a really high GH and a very low KH.So,just having a high GH does not automatically mean that you also have a high KH.For more information on KH,check out FishLab’s detailed guide.Why is aquarium GHGold Plating,Electrodepositedpickling on high strength steels shall be prohibited.3.4 Strikes.When gold plating is preceded by a strike or a strike and underplate,it shall be as specified in the contract or purchase order (see 6.2 and 6.3).For exterior use and when the basis.

AnswersDriveThe higher the level of TDS (ppm),the higher the degree of hardness.Water hardness is typically reported in grains per gallon,milligrams per liter (mg l) or parts per million (ppm).One grain of hardness equals approximately 17.1 ppm (mg L) in TDS.

## Tungsten carbide
Tungsten carbide is approximately twice as stiff as steel,with a Young's modulus of approximately 530 700 GPa (77,000 to 102,000 ksi),and is double the density of steel—nearly midway between that of lead and gold.It is comparable with corundum (α Al2 O 3) in hardness and can only be polished and finished with abrasives of superior hardness such as cubic boron nitride and diamond powder.Nickel PlatingAt low phosphorus levels,the electroless nickel coatings have high wear resistance and excellent corrosion resistance.As phosphorus levels increase,the hardness at as deposited condition increases.Hardness can be improved by heat treatment that can
