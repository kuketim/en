## Making cement sustainable
Making cement involves heating limestone and clay to 1450&#176;C (2640&#176;F),which both consumes energy and releases carbon dioxide.The process also requires large amounts of fresh water.Yet the reason cement plays such a major role in carbon dioxide emissions comes down to the sheer amount of concrete being poured worldwide.Corrosion Resistance of ConcreteThe first line of defense against corrosion of reinforcement is to inhibit the penetration of water,oxygen,carbon dioxide,and salts from the concrete surface to the reinforcement.Quite a few tests try to assess permeability,diffusion,absorption,or other direct measures of fluid penetration resistance.The most frequently used is ASTM.
