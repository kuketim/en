The ore is then ground finely before the copper bearing sulfide minerals are concentrated by a flotation process which separates the grains of ore mineral from the waste material,or gangue.Depending on the type of copper bearing minerals in the ore and the treatment processes used,the concentrate typically contains between 25 and 30% copper,however may be as high as approximately 60% copper.Centrifugation in Mineral Processing MultotecCentrifugation in mineral processing is achieved by using; Multotec’s industrial centrifuge decanters,also known as centrifugal decanters.These specialised centrifuge decanters reduce waste and.increase overall &amp; separation efficiency.Manufactured by the world renowned centrifuge specialists Siebtechnik,Multotec has successfully supplied and installed centrifugal decanters to mineral.
