## Preliminary Characterisation of Iron Ores for Steel Making,
This is an indication that Jaruwa iron ore will be preferred to Agbaja iron ore for the production of pig iron or direct reduced iron However,associate elements such as sulphur and phosphorus of Jaruwa iron ore are considered to be poisonous since they are higher than the recommended benchmarks of 06 % and 004%,respectively [9,10]agbaja iron ore beneficiation eethuisomernlAgbaja iron ore,a high phosphorus iron ore,has been characterized using a variety of analysis techniques in an attempt to unravel the presentation and distribution of phosphorus in the iron ore (between the iron rich phase and the gangue mineral(s) which will be very useful in planning effective beneficiation and phosphorus removal strategies
