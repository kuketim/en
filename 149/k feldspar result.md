## Why is feldspar pink
If the granite has a lot of pink in it,chances are it is potassium feldspar (K Spar).If it is dominated by white,then the feldspar is probably plag.The pink is the result of potassium.Feldspar6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Feldspar Feldspar Identification of specific feldspars: Alkali feldspars can often be distinguished from plagioclase feldspars because most grains of the latter exhibit albite twinning (see above Crystal structure),which is manifested by parallel lines on certain cleavage surfaces,whereas grains of alkali feldspars do not.This criterion is not,however,absolute; some plagioclase.
