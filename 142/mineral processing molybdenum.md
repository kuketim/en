## An effective approach for improving flotation recovery of.
An effective flotation approach is proposed for improving the recovery of molybdenite fines from a finely disseminated molybdenum ore.To maximize the flotation recovery of molybdenum,process mineralogy of raw ore,contrast tests,optimization of operation conditions and particle size analysis were systematically investigated.Process mineralogy suggests that in the raw ore,61.63% of.Molybdenite Archives Mineral Processing &amp; MetallurgyMolybdenum Ore Processing by Flotation This molybdenum flotation circuit,based on 500 tons per 24 hours is designed for low grade molybdenum ore having high grade streaks and with pyrite quartz gangue.It is also basically sound for many other friable.
