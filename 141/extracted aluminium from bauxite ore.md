## Bayer process Wikipedia
The Bayer process is the principal industrial means of refining bauxite to produce alumina (aluminium oxide) Bauxite,the most important ore of aluminium,contains only 30 60% aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3 ),the rest being a mixture of silica,various iron oxides,and titanium dioxide [1]How can we extract aluminum from bauxite? QuoraThe extraction of aluminum involves two steps that is,purification and electrolysis of alumina 1 Purification of bauxite by Baeyer's process In this process the bauxite ore is heated with concentrated NaOH solution under pressure The alumina dissolves as sodium meta aluminate and other materials.
