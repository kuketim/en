## A novel scale up approach for mechanical flotation …
Scale up methods for flotation cell design have been mainly based on geometrical similitude and dimensional analysis with the use of dimensionless numbers (air flow number,power number,specific power,etc.) in order to reach similar solid suspension and similar pulp mixing conditions at different scales (Gorain,2007).CFD Model for the Design of Large Scale Flotation …24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A CFD model incorporating flotation kinetic expressions is developed to simulate the performance of flotation tanks utilized in water and wastewater treatment plants.The focus here is on tanks that operate without any external means of flow mixing (impeller,etc.),such as Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) tanks,where bubble buoyancy,particle settling,and turbulence are mechanisms …

## Maintenance &amp; safety improvements in flotation cell …
20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Design.There are many small design features in a modern flotation cell which can improve maintenance,whilst still keeping it safe and effective.The flotation mechanism is the heart of a flotation cell and combines a rotating part (rotor) and a static part (stator).Home5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Jameson Cell has 100% accurate scale up reliability.The Jameson Cell was developed to overcome the design and operating inadequacies of conventional flotation cells and column cells.And from its first installation it has been continuously improved to make it easier to use.

The flotation cells are designed for a variety of throughput requirements,ranging from small pilot sized cells with a diameter of 0.8m,processing 6 10 m 3 h of feed; to cells with a diameter of 6.5m,handling feeds of 1500 m 3 h.The flow rate is dependent on the feed pressure and rate of concentrate removal.Scale up in froth flotation: A state of the art review.Although CFD has been used for flotation equipment design,the literature about its use for the scale up of flotation cells is scarce.An example of the use of CFD in flotation equipment design and flotation modelling is the work of Koh et al.[90],who developed a D CFD flotation model.
