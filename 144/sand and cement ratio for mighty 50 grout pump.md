## What is the Difference Between Mortar and Concrete?
Mortar.Mortar is used to hold building materials such as brick or stone together.It is composed of a thick mixture of water,sand,and cement.The water is used to hydrate the cement and hold the mix together.The water to cement ratio is higher in mortar than in concrete in order to form its bonding element.Cement Bentonite Grout Backfill for Borehole Instrumentsapplication.For example,in a gal lon batch of cement lime grout,150 pounds of hydrated lime can be re placed by using about 25 pounds of bentonite powder.Mix Design Rules In order to keep field procedures simple the emphasis should be on controlling

## Practical Method for Mix Design of Cement based Grout
For the application in soil improvement,the cement based grout mix is recommended to utilize well graded sand [3].The volumetric ratio of cement : sand of 1 : 2 can be used as long as the sand passes a 1.20 mm sieve,with the amount of sand that passes 0US5241993AA pumpable cement grout and method for use thereof for grouting annular cavities.The pumpable cement grout is a mixture of a hydraulic cement,water in an amount sufficient so that the water to cement ratio of the grout is from about 0.60 to about 1.00 by weight,and pregenerated aqueous foam in an amount sufficient to adjust the wet density of the grout to a value of from about 48 to about.
