## Our Products
These pellets are high quality with a clean chemistry,which helps to lower the carbon footprint,compared to lower quality grades and forms of iron ore,when used in the iron &amp; steel industry.We take pride in ensuring that these products are of consistent,reliable and replicable quality; within cargoes and between cargoes.Table I from Microwaves Applied to Carbothermic ‚Ä¶&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Results of reduction tests conducted on iron ore pellets with carbon are presented in this work.Work done is centered on reduction kinetics using carbon as the reducing agent with a conventional heat supply (heat transfer process) compared with reduction kinetics where heat is supplied by microwaves to the whole volume.
