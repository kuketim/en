## refractory ore processing gold
The Mining Process newmont For example,ore that has a high level of sulfide minerals or carbon (or both) is called refractory ore.Refractory ore resists normal processing methods as the high sulfide minerals trap gold particles,making it difficult for the cyanide toPretreatment Process on Refractory Gold Ores with AsGold ores are considered refractory if gold extractions from a conventional cyanidation process are less than 80% even after fine grinding.1) Arsenic bearing refractory gold ore has stones extremely difficult to deal with.In the stones,gold is locked up in arsenic.

## Refractory and Non Refractory Ore
Refractory and Non refractory are relative terms,and the degree to which any ore is amenable to cyanide extraction will range from near 0% through to near 100%.Whether gold is refractory or non refractory has a huge bearing on a potential mine's viability.Biological Oxidation of refractory gold ore&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Here is a simplified presentation of how gold can be obtained from refractory gold ores using a combination of flotation and bacterial oxidation using thiobacillus ferroxidans.
