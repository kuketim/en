## Rod mills,how they function
Rod mills normally carry 35 to 65% rod charge by volume.The limits on charge level are (1) keeping the feed end trunnion open so that feed will get into the mill,and (2) keeping the rod charge low so rods will not work their way into discharge opTECHNICAL NOTES 8 GRINDING R.P.KingFigure 8.2 Media motion in the tumbling mill.8.1 Grinding 8.1.1 Grinding action Industrial grinding machines used in the mineral processing industries are mostly of the tumbling mill type.These mills exist in a variety of types rod,ball,pebble autogenous and semi autogenous.The grindin
