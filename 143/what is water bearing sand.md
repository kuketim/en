## California bearing ratio Wikipedia
The California bearing ratio (CBR) is a penetration test for evaluation of the mechanical strength of natural ground,The basic site test is performed by measuring the pressure required to penetrate soil or aggregate with a plunger of standard areaAquiferAn aquifer is an underground layer of water bearing permeable rock,rock fractures or unconsolidated materials (gravel,sand,or silt).Groundwater can be extracted using a water well.The study of water flow in aquifers and the characterization of aquifers is called hydrogeology.
