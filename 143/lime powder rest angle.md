The angle of repose is the minimum angle at which any piled up bulky or loose material will stand without falling downhill.One way to demonstrate this would be to pour sand from a bag to the ground.There is a minimum angle or maximum slope the sand will maintain due to the forces of gravity and the effect of friction between the particles of sand.Flow Properties of Powders and Bulk SolidsDietmar Schulze: Flow Properties of Powders and Bulk Solids page 3 Figure 2: Force equilibrium on an element of bulk solid,the Mohr stress circle An important qualitative result of the above analysis is that shear stresses can occur in bulk solids at rest.This is.
