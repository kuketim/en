## Ball Mill
The ball mill is the most important equipment in the beneficiation equipment,and the structure is reasonable and price concessions.Dry grinding and wet grinding are all possible,and the fineness is about 800 mesh,which can be adjusted.RawmillOccasionally,the mill is preceded by a hot air swept hammer mill which does most of the drying and produces millimetre sized feed for the mill.Ball mills are rather inefficient,and typically require 10 20 kW&#183;h of electric power to make a tonne of rawmix.The Aerofall mill is sometimes used for pre grinding large wet feeds.
