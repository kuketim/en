## Concrete
Concrete is strong in compression,as the aggregate efficiently carries the compression load.However,it is weak in tension as the cement holding the aggregate in place can crack,allowing the structure to fail.Reinforced concrete adds either steel reinforcing bars,steel fibers,aramid fibers,carbon fibers,glass fibers,or plastic fibers to carry tensile loads.How calculate cement Sand and Aggregates consumptionWe have to define concrete by unit contents of concrete and w c ratio,besides the cement strength.We must use only weigh batching,never volume batching,however the small job may be.Dear Vikas.

## what is cement content per m for m concrete
&#183; in this Video Lecture you are able to Learn what is grade of concrete and water cement ratio in detail.and also concrete grade table with water cement ratio.Minimum cement Content required for mild exposure condition = 300 kg m 3.kg m 3 &gt; 300.What is Water Cement Ratio?What is Water Cement Ratio? Water Cement Ratio means the ratio between the weight of water to the weight of cement used in concrete mix.Normally water cement ratio falls under 0.4 to 0.6 as per IS C (2009) for nominal mix (M10,M15 ….M25)

## What is Water Cement Ratio?
But as I used the word “minimum” so definitely a concrete mix with w c ratio of 0.35 may not mix thoroughly.So generally for normal concrete mixes,a water cement ratio of 0.45 to 0.60 is selected during mix design.IS c of 2009 also quotes thehow we calculate of Sand,cement and aggregate of M20 …4.4 bag of cement is required for 1cum of concrete work in M10.volume of dry concrete =1.54 times volume of.You can go through the reference of Ambuja Cement booklets on concrete 8th Aug.

Concretes without admixtures and of high cement content,(over about 460 kg m 3) are liable to prove difficult to pump,because of high friction between the concrete and the pipeline.Cement contents below 270 to 320 kg m 3 depending upon the proportion of the aggregate may also prove difficult to pump because of segregation within the pipe line.CONCRETE MIXES GUIDELINEConcrete is a building material that has high compressive strength and low tensile strength and is composed of a mixture of cement,gravel and sand (aggregates),and water.Reinforced Concrete is the same material matrix combined with reinforcing
