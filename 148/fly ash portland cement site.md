Product Information Outline.A cement made by mixing ordinary Portland cement with fly ash in compliance with the Japanese &quot;JIS A 6201 fly ash for concrete&quot; standard,offering concrete fluidity equivalent to that of ordinary Portland cement but with less mixing water by comparison,thus reducing hydration heat as well.The Disadvantages of Fly Ash in Concrete HunkerFly ash is a byproduct from coal fired power plants that is frequently used as an admixture in concrete to replace a portion of the Portland cement.Using fly ash in concrete is environmentally beneficial because it reduces the Portland cement (a major contributor of CO2) required in concrete.

(with pictures)16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Fly ash cement is a primary ingredient in certain concretes that is often used as an alternative to Portland cement,which is a more traditional concrete base.The ash itself is a byproduct of coal combustion,but once formed into a cement the ash usually binds in such a way as to neutralize many of the chemicals and toxins that have made coal burning so controversial in recent years.
