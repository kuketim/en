## Drinking Water Contaminant Iron and manganese bacteria.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;When water from aquifers containing iron and manganese is exposed to air,these elements are oxidized (combine with oxygen) to less water soluble forms.Upon oxidation,colored forms of iron and manganese become visible in water.In the case of iron,white,then yellow and finally red brown solid particles form that settle out of the water.Mining for iron oxides in coal mine sludge EARTH MagazineOnce the mine water meets the air,dissolved iron oxidizes,forming a brightly colored solid oxide,often affectionately called “yellow boy,” says Philip Sibrell of the U.S.Geological Survey in Kearneysville,W.Va.“This precipitate coats the bottom of streams and that chokes out aquatic life.”
