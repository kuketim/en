## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores.
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The Chemistry of Copper ElectrolysisThe Chemistry of Copper Electrolysis HANDS ON ACTIVITY OBJECTIVES Apply basic chemistry principles to understand the process of electrolysis Understand how electrolysis is used in the processing of copper ores TIME REQUIRED Thirty minutes to set up and up to 60 minutes to run the electrolysis
