American Geosciences InstituteBiomining is mineral processing with microbes.Biomining is the process of using microorganisms (microbes) to extract metals of economic interest from rock ores or mine waste.Biomining techniques may also be used to clean up sites that have been polluted with metals.Valuable metals are commonly bound up in solid minerals.Some microbes can oxidize those metals,allowing them to dissolve in.
