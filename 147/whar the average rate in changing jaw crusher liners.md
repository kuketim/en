## Liner wear in jaw crushers
1.Introduction.Jaw and cone crushers are commonly used in the mining and aggregates industry.Today,it is possible to predict the performance of a cone crusher,provided the geometry,crusher settings and the characteristics of the material fed into the crusher are known (Evertsson,2000).The geometry of the crusher will change because of wear.Heavy duty crushing and screening train sets the gold.Initially the UJ440i jaw crusher was fed directly by a size front end loader at an average rate of 330 tonnes per hour (tph),with peak loads up to 380 tph.The primary UJ440i jaw crusher was approximately set at a 100mm closed side setting (CSS),feeding directly into the secondary QS441 cone crusher.
