## Experimental study of concrete made with granite and …
The concrete mix made using granite powder (GP) and iron powder (IP) as partial replacement of sand showed good workability and fluidity similar to normal concrete mixes.2.The compressive strength of concrete increased with the addition of granite powder (GP) as partial replacement of sand.16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Thus,the cost of construction can be controlled by the use of manufactured sand as an alternative material for construction.The other advantage of using M Sand is,it can be dust free,the sizes of m sand can be controlled easily so that it meets the required grading for the given construction.CIVILCIVIL EXPERIMENTAL PROJECTS CEX001.Experimental Investigation on Replacement of Sand by Graded Quarry Dust in Concrete CEX002.Experimental Investigation on Partial Replacement of Cement with Glass Powder.Compressive Strength of Concrete by Using Lateritic Sand and Quarry Dust CEX042.Use of Industrial Waste Red Mud in the Production of.9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;of rock flour and reported that the rock flour can be used as alternative material in place of sand in concrete based on grain size data.Rao,et al (1996) have reported that sand can be replaced.replacement attained at 30% of crusher dust is due to filling up of formed voids partly with.A STUDY ON THE USE OF CRUSHED STONE AGGREGATE.
