Total weight of residue = w 2 = 13.4 gram % age of fineness = 86.6 %.COMMENTS: “The fineness of cement is not according to the ASTM standard,so the cement is not perfectly fresh therefore it should not be used for making concrete where high strength is required but can be used for low load structures as fineness is not too bad”.Fineness Modulus of Sand for ConcreteFineness of fine aggregate is related to term fineness modulus; most commonly sand.Fineness modulus is a measure to define fineness of aggregate precisely it defines coarseness or fineness of aggregate to be used in concrete.

6.For concrete containing no entrained air,there is a slight decrease in the static modulus of elasticity at 28 days' age as the fineness is increased.The modulus of elasticity of concrete determined by sonic methods decreases as the fineness of the cement increases.7.The fineness of cement influences the drying shrinkage of concrete.When.7 Physical Test of Cement to Justify Its Quality1.Fineness Test.Fineness is the mean size of cement grain.It is done to measure the mean size of cement grain.The finer the cement the surface area for hydration will be large and it increases the strength of cement.But the fineness varies in different types of cement.One of the Following three methods can be applied to test the fineness.

Methods of finding fineness of cement: Fineness of cement is found by two methods A) By method of dry sieving B) By specific surface method finding fineness of cement using Blanine's air permeability apparatus.Though method B is more accurate it is rarely used for specific purpose.Method A is quite good for field work.Fineness Modulus of Concrete AggregatesFineness Modulus (FM) of concrete aggregates is an empirical figure representing the mean particle size of an aggregate sample.The number is required in the selection of proportions for the concrete mix design process,but its real influence is not always understood by users.
