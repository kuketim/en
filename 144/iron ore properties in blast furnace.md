## Describe the extraction of Iron from its Hematite ore in the …
EXTRACTION OF IRON: The most important raw materials or ores from which iron metal extracted are oxide ores i.e.hematite (Fe2O3) or limonite (Fe2O3.3H2O).The first stage involved in the manufacture of iron is the reduction of oxide ores in a blast furnace as.22.Iron and The Old Stone Furnaces of Western …The honor of having been the first American blast furnace to use Lake Superior iron ore occurred in 1853 when,owners,David and John P.Agnew used the ore in the Sharpsville Furnace,Mercer County,Pennsylvania.Lake Superior iron ore was far superior than local ores,much higher metal percentage.
