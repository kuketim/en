## Grinding Mills: Ball Mill &amp; Rod Mill Design &amp; Parts
Common types of grinding mills include Ball Mills and Rod Mills.This includes all rotating mills with heavy grinding media loads.This article focuses on ball and rod mills excluding SAG and AG mills.Although their concepts are very similar,they are not discussed here.Photographs of a glass ended laboratory ball mill show action of ball mass within the mill.The action of other grinding.Chapter 18.Feed Milling ProcessesThe mill also includes the processes of attrition and impact,although these actions are limited if the material is easily reduced by cutting and the screen limiting discharge has large perforations.The mill consists of a rotating shaft with four attached parallel knives and a …
