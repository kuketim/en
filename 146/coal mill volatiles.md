## Boiler Performance and Mill Outlet Temperature
Two major parameters which decide the mill capacity and performance are the hardness of coal and the total moisture level in coal.The mill outlet temperature of coal air mixture is maintained between 65 to 90 degree centigrade in the case of low and medium volatile coal.In the case of high volatile coal while the lower limit generaCoal Mill Coal Grinding Mill Coal Grinding Machine Vipeak.Coal dust is a type of fine coal powder ground by coal grinding mill,size range 0.05~0.01mm,and most of powder’s size range 20~50μm.Pulverized coal processed by Vipeak grinding machine could be fully burned,use ratio very high,and we have provided technical support for many power plant.
