## Cone Volume Calculator
Truncated cone volume (volume of frustum) A truncated cone is the cone with the top cut off,with a cut perpendicular to the height.You can calculate frustum volume by subtracting smaller cone volume (the cut one) from the bigger base one,or use the formula: volume = (1 3) * π * depth * (r&#178; + r * R + R&#178;),where R is a radius of the base of.How to Calculate the Volume of a Cone: 5 Steps (with …6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;To calculate the volume of a cone,start by finding the cone's radius,which is equal to half of its diameter.Next,plug the radius into the formula A = πr^2,where A is the area and r is the radius.Once you have the area,multiply it by the height of the cone.Finally,divide that number by 3 to find the volume of the cone.
