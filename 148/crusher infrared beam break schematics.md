## Overview IR Breakbeam Sensors Adafruit Learning System
Infrared (IR) break beam sensors are a simple way to detect motion.They work by having an emitter side that sends out a beam of human invisible IR light,then a receiver across the way which is sensitive to that same light.When something passes between the two,and its not transparent to IR,then the 'beam is broken' and the receiver will let.Long Range (10mt) IR Beam Break DetectorShortly after i published my IR Short Distance Beam Cut Detector circuit,i began receiving emails and comments,asking how to increase the range.As a matter of fact,that circuit was designed for a very specific application: it had to be precise and sensitive enough,because i wanted to use it for the straw separator of my coffee maker machine.

## Arduino connection with a beam break sensor
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;I'm working on a project that needs to identify the amount of people in a room.I'm doing that by using 2 break beam IR sensors.I bought a DIY kit in maplin to see if it works.It was cheap and it seems it does.HowIR Break Beam Hot Wheels Car Speed TrackToday I bring you a fun little project.The goal of the project is to measure the speed of toy cars as they run the length of a track.Kids and adults can compete to see who has the fastest car.The track is setup using two IR (infrared) break b

40kHz IR Tester Use this circuit to test if the light coming from your 40khz IR emitter is really emitting the right frequency.The schematic says to use a GP1U5X ir module,but probably any 40khz detector module will work. Designed by Andy WilsonInfrared Beam Break DetectorIn this case,the IR sensor senses 38kHz pulsed infrared light.Pin 3 of the IR sensor is actually low (0V) while receiving a signal.When the sensor is blocked from receiving the IR signal,the sensor outputs a high signal to the comparator,which then allows current through the LED Buzzer circuit,
