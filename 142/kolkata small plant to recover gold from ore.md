## Flour Gold Recovery
Flour gold can be defined as ultra fine gold found in a low micron size fraction,often smaller than 74 microns or 200 mesh.Reality is that with today’s fine gold recovery equipment,this is a low ways away from the elusive microscopic gold small prospectors want to know how to recover.Complete gold recovery processing line for gold ore&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;We had a customer send us some very high grade gold quartz ore which we recovered 1.310 troy ounces from only 300 lbs! We ran the quartz through our 1 1 ton per hour complete turnkey processor.

## Gold extraction
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.[1] Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold.Gold cyanidationGold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low grade ore by converting the gold to a water soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction.[1] Production of reagents for mineral processing to.
