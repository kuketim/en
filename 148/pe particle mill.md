## Mill (grinding)
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.horse mill),wind or water ().Sieving with Retschthe flow characteristics and solubility of washing powders depend on the fineness and particle shape of the basic materials; RETSCH sieve shakers,test sieves and evaluation software provide the key to easy,rapid,reproducible and,above all,accurate analyses.
