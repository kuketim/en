## Ball Mill Design Power Calculation
The basic parameters used in ball mill design (power calculations),rod mill or any tumbling mill sizing are; material to be ground,characteristics,Bond Work Index,bulk density,specific density,desired mill tonnage capacity DTPH,operating % solids or pulp density,feed size as F80 and maximum ‘chunk size’,product size as P80 and maximumThe grinding balls bulk weight in fully unloaded mill&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;It is done in order to accurately definition the grinding ball mass during measuring in a ball mill and exclude the mill overloading with grinding balls possibility There are two methods for determining the grinding balls bulk weight in a mill: Method with complete grinding media discharge from the mill inner drum.

## Choosing the Best Media Mill For Your Wet Grinding Application
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Every mill is limited in cooling surface area and therefore limited to the maximum amount of energy that can be used for grinding.This dictates the installed motor power for a mill.The nominal energy density of a mill is the available energy per volume of milling chamber.Energy Density = Installed Motor Power (kW) Mill Chamber Volume (liters)Tubular Rod MillsA uniform discharge from a closed circuit jaw crusher is 200 t h.The crusher feeds a wet rod mill such that 80% of the crusher product passes a 16 mm screen.The rod mill feeds a wet ball mill at a feed size of 1.0 mm (1000 μm) and produces a product with 80% passing a 150 μm screen.The rod mill is in an open grinding circuit.Determine: 1.
