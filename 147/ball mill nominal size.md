Ball mills are among the most variable and effective tools when it comes to size reduction of hard,brittle or fibrous materials.The variety of grinding modes,usable volumes and available grinding tool materials make ball mills the perfect match for a vast range of applications.ITP Mining: Water Use in Industries of the Future: Mining.nominal Net use net solids and net water makeup Ball Rod Mill 500 700 150 300 nominal nominal sand size material (3 16 inch to &#188; inch and be&#173; low) is withdrawn with a sand screw (about half of the installations).b.As an alternative,the fraction passing through the screen may be classified according to size in a gravity classi&#173;

## Ball Mill: Operating principles,components,Uses.
A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis.The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 50%Variables in Ball Mill Operation Paul O.Abbe&#174;The first problem will ball mills is that we cannot see what is occurring in the mill.The other problem is that many of the independent variables are non linear or have paradoxical effects on the end results.In ball milling of dry solids the main independent variables are mill diameter,mill speed,media size,solids loading and residence time.

## Ball Mill
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore.The balls are initially 5 10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds.The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol. % ore and 25% steel.The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle size measurement device andCALCULATION OF MAXIMUM BALL SIZE FOR BALL MILL GRINDING&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Mill effective diameter = 2.23 m.335 is a constant used for dry grinding with steel balls in the mill.Actual size of media is taken is lower than the calculated value.It is around 80 to 90 mm.If you Wants to reduce the maximum ball size,thenreduce the feed size by using pre grinding operation.
