## Bauxite ore Britannica
Bauxite,rock largely composed of a mixture of hydrous aluminum oxides.Bauxite is the principal ore of aluminum.Bauxites vary physically according to the origin and geologic history of their deposits: some deposits are soft,easily crushed,and structureless; some are hard,dense,and pisolitic,Uses of BauxiteIn terms of physical properties,Bauxite formula has a different composition.What it means is that bauxite contains a mixture of oxides like aluminium hydroxides,hydrous aluminium oxides,and minerals like gibbsite,boehmite and diaspore including some clay minerals.It also contains,insoluble materials namely magnetite,quartz,siderite,hematite and goethite.

## What are the chief characteristics of bauxite?
(ii) Bauxite deposits are formed by the decomposition of a wide variety of rocks rich in aluminium silicates.(iii) Aluminium is an important metal because it combines the strength of metals such as iron with extreme lightness and also with good conductivity and great malleability.
