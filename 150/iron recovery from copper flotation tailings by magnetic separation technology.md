## An Experimental Investigation on the Copper …
In this study,the possibility of copper recovery from flotation tailing of Mazraeh copper mine was investigated.Magnetic separation method was used for concentration of non magnetic minerals,especially copper bearing minerals,from iron minerals.As a result,copper grade increased up to 0.18% and its recovery reached 86%.Due to mineral’s oxidized surface,accompanied oxide minerals and.flotation tailings cnkiThe results show that the fluorite concentrate with the grade of CaF2 97.84 %,SiO2 0.95% and recovery of 69.97 % is obtained from the flotation tailings of wolframite with grade of CaF2 22.89 % by the new technology,and the wolframite and garnet are comprehensively recovered from the magnetic part simultaneously.

## Recovery of pyrite from copper tailings by flotation.
The recovery of iron from tailings has also been studied using magnetic separation after a pre thermal treatment to transform the iron ores into magnetite.The objective of this study was to design a flotation circuit to produce pyrite concentrate of commercial interest from fresh tailings generated in a concentrator plant from the Atacama.Iron Recovery from Baosteel Rare Earth Flotation Tailings by.An experimental study was conducted on the iron recovery from the tailings of BaoSteel rare earth flotation by microwave carbothermic reduction plus magnetic separation.At a temperature below 570 ℃,more than 85% of the hematite in the tailings was reduced.

## Recovering Iron from Iron Ore Tailings and Preparing.
Iron ore tailings (IOTs) are a form of solid waste produced during the beneficiation process of iron ore concentrate.In this paper,iron recovery from IOTs was studied at different points during a process involving pre concentration followed by direct reduction and magnetic separation.Then,slag tailing concrete composite admixtures were prepared from high silica residues.Based on the.
