A process for forming cement clinker using mill scale that may have hydrocarbons associated therewith.Normal feedstock material is preheated and then transferred to a combustion area.The mill scale is also transferred to the combustion area where,during the process of burning a material,the unwanted hydrocarbons are volatilized and converted to harmless gaseous products (by combustion.Mention Process Involved In Cement Mill ChambersThe cement manufacturing process starts from the mining of raw materials that are used in cement manufacturing,mainly limestone and clays.A limestone quarry is inside the plant area and a clays quarry is as far from the plant area as 25 km.The cement mill.Cement manufacturing brief description of a cement mill.Cement clinker is usually.
