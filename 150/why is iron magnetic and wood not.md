Feb 26,2020&#0183;&#32;Why is iron magnetic and wood is not? The spinning of the charged electron creates a magnetic moment,which in turn can align with an external magnet,thus making iron magnetic Atoms of wood do not have unpaired electron spins that can line up with a magnet,and so it is non magneticNondestructive Evaluation Physics : MagnetismMagnetic Field The space in which a magnetic force is exerted This space exists within and around a magnetized material and a conductor carrying electrical current around a single magnet Magnet Any piece of iron,steel or magnetite that has the property of attracting iron or steel

## magnetism National Geographic Society
That is why materials such as cloth or paper are said to be weakly magnetic In substances such as iron,cobalt,and nickel,most of the electrons spin in the same direction This makes the atoms in these substances strongly magnetic—but they are not yet magnetsWhat Kinds of Metals Do Not Stick to Magnets? SciencingYou probably know that magnets don't stick to nonmetal (diamagnetic) materials such as wood,plastic,glass,cotton and wool,but you may not know that magnets don't stick to all metals.In fact,most metals are not magnetic.
