## Cast iron Wikipedia
Cast iron is made from pig iron,which is the product of melting iron ore in a blast furnace Cast iron can be made directly from the molten pig iron or by re melting pig iron,often along with substantial quantities of iron,steel,limestone,carbon (coke) and taking various steps to remove undesirable contaminantsMuhammad Rashed Al Mamun and Shuichi Toriihydrogen sulfide has detrimental effects on the cast iron and steel used equipment Moreover,the failure to eliminate the corrosive and toxic H 2 S in raw biogas has been the drawback of many biogas applications Therefore,H 2 S must be removed prior to further utilization Common H 2 S removal technologies for H 2 S removal

## Cast iron
Cast iron is a group of iron carbon alloys with a carbon content greater than 2%.[1] Its usefulness derives from its relatively low melting temperature.The alloy constituents affect its colour when fractured: white cast iron has carbide impurities which allow cracks to pass straight through,grey cast iron has graphite flakes which deflect a.Cast irons Harry BhadeshiaAn illustration of the ductility of spheroidal graphite cast iron Photograph reproduced from Physical Metallurgy of Engineering Materials,by E R Petty,with permission from the Institute of Materials: Spheroidal graphite cast iron,Fe 32C 25Si 005Mg wt%,containing graphite nodules in a matrix which is pearlitic
