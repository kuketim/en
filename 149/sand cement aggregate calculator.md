## What Are the Mix Ratios for Cement and Sand,
The basic mix ratio for concrete is one part water,two parts cement and three parts sand An alternative ratio is one part cement,two parts sand and three parts gravel with enough water added until the mixtures reaches the consistency of thick mud Lime is also a common additive to the mix.how we calculate of Sand,cement and aggregate of …M20 (1 cement :1.5 sand :3 stone brick aggregate).To determine the proportions you have to perform mix design,for this you have to find out the sp.gr.of cement,CA,FA,and water cement ratio.
