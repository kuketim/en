## Coal Bottom Ash Boiler Slag
The most common type of coal burning furnace in the electric utility industry is the dry bottom pulverized coal boiler.When pulverized coal is burned in a dry bottom boiler,about 80 percent of the unburned material or ash is entrained in the flue gas and is captured and recovered as fly ash.Performance characteristics of pulverized coal burner.25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Pulverized coal burner has seven performance characteristics: 1.Pulverized coal burner can effectively reduce coal consumption.Theory and practice show that each 1% reduction in primary air volume can reduce heat consumption of 8.70 ~ 10.46kJ kg fuel,and at the same time,the secondary air temperature is significantly increased.The ignition of pulverized coal burner is easy,and the working.
