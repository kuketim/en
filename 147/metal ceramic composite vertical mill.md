## Fatigue Resistance of CAD CAM Resin Composite Molar Crowns
CAD CAM resin composite restorations have several advantages over their ceramic counterparts: (1) Resin composite blocks are milling damage tolerant,which allows for a faster milling speed and provides better marginal quality ; a full contour crown takes only 6 minutes to mill ! (2) No post milling firing is needed.Binder JettingFoundry sand can be printed into complex shaped sand casting molds and cores by Binder Jetting.Aluminum or steel truss structures and metal ceramic composite materials have been fabricated at VT FIRE (the foundry) using molds and cores printed by Binder Jetting.Learn more.Our Systems.ExOne R2.R2 is a legacy metal printer from ExOne.
