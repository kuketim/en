What Is Induction? We have seen how &#216rsted was able to demonstrate that electric currents can produce magnetic fields.The English physicist Michael Faraday,a brilliant experimentalist,was the first to demonstrate the converse effect: magnetic fields can be used to induce electric currents.This is now called the principle of magnetic induction.It is interesting to note that Faraday hadMagnetic Pinch Effect in the Thermal rf …This excess magnetic pressure.Magnetic Pinch Effect in the Thermal rf Induction Plasma.In addition to the applied radio frequency.
