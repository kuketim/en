## Neodymium magnet
A neodymium magnet (also known as NdFeB,NIB or Neo magnet) is the most widely used type of rare earth magnet.It is a permanent magnet made from an alloy of neodymium,iron,and boron to form the Nd 2 Fe 14 B tetSolutionsNeodymium magnets are frequently used for many types of consumer,commercial,industrial &amp; technical applications where strong permanent magnets are required.Due to their high magnetic Strength,components that previously had to be large and heavy can now be miniaturized by using Neodymium magnet material.

## Neodymium Magnets
In the 1980s using powdered neodymium iron boron,magnets were produced with forces almost 75 times stronger than magnetite.These are now commonly referred to as neo magnets or rare earth magnets and are also referred to as NdFeB or NIB magnets.Magnetic Chute (Hammer Mill Plate Magnet)Magnetic Chute,Chute Magnet,Hammer Mill Plate Magnet,Underflow Magnet,Plate Magnet,Quick Clean Plate Magnets,Food Grade Magnetic Plate Chute Magnet extracts Tramp Iron from chopped sugar cane during processing to ensure that crushing rolls are not damages and that crushing rolls are not damages and that the finished product is free from ferrous contamination.

The Neodymium Iron Boron material is very hard and brittle,so machining is difficult at best.The hardness of the material is RC46 on the Rockwell &quot;C&quot; scale,which is harder than commercially available drills and tooling,so these tools will heat up and become damaged if used on NdFeB material.
