## Why Pulverized Coal is Used in a Power Plant
Coal for Power Plants.The coal fired power plant converts energy in coal to electricity.The basic input into the system is the fuel that is coal.All other systems and equipment only aid in this conversion process.Before going into the details,let us look at the quantity of coal processed in a power plant.Coal mill optimisation in coal fired power.This is all controlled by the coal mill or pulveriser,and its associated feeder equipment.Operation of the coal mill can affect the ramp rate of the power station and its ability to handle rapid changes in output.For coal fired power plants,the response time of the coal mills is critical for the overall reaction time to changing demand.
