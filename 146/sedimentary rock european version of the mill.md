As more and more layers piled up,their weight pressed down to form solid rock— limestone.Limestone is a sedimentary rock.All sedimentary rock is formed by layers deposited,one on top of the other,over a long period.Sedimentary rock can form from layers of dirt,sand,shells,plants or other material.Rocks of NorwayDark ultramafic rock (close to the peridotite pyroxenite boundary) with a very large garnet crystal.Such ultramafic rocks probably originate from the mantle wedge above the subduction zones where the rocks got enriched in recycled material that enabled the growth of the large g
