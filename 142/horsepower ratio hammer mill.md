## HAMMER MILLS: FIVE KEY STYLES
Hammer Mills The nearly 300 degree screen coverage of the rotor translates to a greater area for the material to exit the grinding chamber.As a result,in comparison to other mill styles,the full circle screen hammer mill has the highest throughput to horsepower ratio.Important to know: To achieve the nearly full coverage of the rotorHigh Speed Hammermills For Fine Grinding: Part 2The efficiency of the grinding operation will depend on a number of variables including but not limited to: tip speed,screen (hole) size and open area,screen area horsepower ratio,hammer pattern (number of hammers),hammer position (coarse or fine),uniform
