Concrete blocks are made in three different types,which includes solid,hollow and interlocking.Concrete blocks are typically classified into a category by their density or unit weight.Density is determined by the amount and type of aggregates added in the concrete mixture to produce lightweight,medium and normal weight concrete blocks.Concrete Block (CMU) Sizes,Shapes,and Finishes.5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Concrete blocks also come in half sizes,which are helpful in reducing the need to cut blocks in the field at corners or the end of walls.The architect should always attempt to design buildings using the nominal dimensions to the nearest half block size to reduce waste and labor due to cut blocks.
