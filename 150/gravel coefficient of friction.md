## Coefficient of Friction Definition,Formula and FAQs
For a detailed understanding of the concept of coefficient of friction,we should be well versed with the idea of friction,friction force,type of friction,etc Friction can be defined as the resistance to relative motion between two surfaces in contact,ie,two surfaces might be in contact while sliding,rolling,or in the state of restThe friction is usually caused due to the rough.What is the coefficient of friction of a tire on a gravel,Answer (1 of 3): Well,the answer to the second part of the question is that it doesn't It is conceivable that the frictional force might change with velocity,but it certainly won't be affected by acceleration and the coefficient would technically be constant at all tim It is important to r.

## 摩擦系数 百度百科 baikebaidu
摩擦系数是指两表面间的摩擦力和作用在其一表面上的垂直力之比值。它是和表面的粗糙度有关，而和接触面积的大小无关。依运动的性质，它可分为动摩擦系数和静摩擦系数。滑动摩擦力是两物体相互接触发生相对滑动而产生的。TABLE C l Friction Coefficient for Concrete Cast on Soil,Friction Coefficient for Concrete Cast on Soil (reference 4) Friction Interface Materials Coefficient,f Mass concrete on the following foundation materials: Clean sound rock 070 Clean gravel,gravel sand mixtures,coarse sand 055 to 060 Clean fine to medium sand,silty medium to coarse sand,silty or clayey gravel 045 to 055.
