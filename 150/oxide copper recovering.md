## Copper Mining and Extraction Sulfide Ores
Copper minerals and ore are found throughout the Earth’s crust.They occur in both sedimentary and igneous rocks.The outer 10 km of the crust contains 33 g of copper for every tonne of rock.This is not enough to make it commercially viable to extract the rock.inorganic chemistryWe resulted in getting some copper flakes,but as a consequence the copper was replaced by aluminum in the chloride solution.So technically it is still a waste material that can't be used in everyday life,despite having recovered the copper.
