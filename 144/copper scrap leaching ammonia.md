## Dissolution Rate of Copper in Aqueous Ammonia Solution
It is desirable to obtain high copper dissolution rate for relnoval of copper from ferrous scrap by ammonia leaching In this study,a new ammonia leaching process using a injection rnethod in a closed circuit system is proposed to improve copper dissolution rate and to prevent ammonia from vaporization lossPatent US2647829 Decomposition of copper scrap and.Leaching of normal copper scrap with these dilute solutions requires that the scrap remain in the.and containing sumcient ammonia to keep the copper in.

01 01 1994&#0183;&#32;When the scrap was leached in the mixed solution of ammonia and ammonium carbonate with 0 to 1cm3 hydrogen peroxide for 2 hours,no extraction of copper was obtained in spite of oxygen gas blowing In contrast with this,by addition of hydrogen peroxide over 2cm3,almost all copper was extracted for 2 hoursAqueous ammonia oxidative leach and recovery of metal.Jul 06,1976&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Certain mineral values are recovered from source material such as ore,scrap metal,and mixtures in the presence of another metal thereof by aqueous.

## Improved Cupric Ammonium Carbonate Leaching of Copper Scrap
Alternatives were developed to the conventional ammoniacal carbonate leaching steam stripping procedure for recovering copper as an oxide from contaminated scrap metal By entraining air bubbles in the leach solution,the copper dissolution rate was increased to 15 G in2 of copper,Selective Separation and Recovery of Copper from Iron …27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Selective Separation and Recovery of Copper.process to remove copper from ferrous scrap at low cost is required.1).(II) are the most suitable for ammonia leaching of copper.Using these optimized concentrations,copper plates were immersed and stirred at 353 K.
