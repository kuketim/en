Gold ore can be classified as free milling,complex,or refractory and each type of ore has different challenges when it comes to processing methods.Cyanidation with CIL CIP continues to be the most common method,although there are environmental concerns due to toxicity.refractory gold ArchivesA recently released feasibility study on the project showed that the second POX line would meaningfully increase the value of Polymetal’s refractory reserve base,comprising approximately 55% of total ore reserves,processing concentrates from its Kyzyl,Nezhda,Mayskoye,and Voro mines.

## Newmont Gold Company Gold Mine
Newmont Mining Corp.started mining gold at Carlin,Nevada,USA in 1965 and thereafter built up a strong land position in the state.Newmont Gold Company later became the company’s only major asset,while the acquisition of Santa Fe Pacific Gold in 1997 increased Newmont’s options for optimising mining and processing.Gold processing Britannica5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Gold processing,preparation of the ore for use in various products.Native gold is the most common mineral of gold,accounting for about 80 percent of the metal in the Earth’s crust.It occasionally is found as nuggets as large as 12 millimetres (0.5 inch) in diameter,and on rare occasions.

## Refractory Gold Processes
Gold can be leached and extracted recovered in several ways.Even if you gold is “refractory” in pyrite or arsenopyrite,you can still get much value from your ore rock depending on the economics of capital and operating cost.The cheapest and fastest option is to simply grind and CIL the whole thing according the the process flowsheet here shown.mineral processing and metallurgical technology.This paper describes a comprehensive utilization technigue for i.e,a by product,complex sulphide ore of Tungsten mines.The authors suggest a combined mineral processing and metallurgical technology,which was applied to the treatment of a by product a complex sulphide mineral of shao Guan Clearing mill.of shao Guan Clearing mill.
