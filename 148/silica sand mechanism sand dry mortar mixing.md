## Effect of Morphology and Dispersibility of Silica.
The influence of powdered and colloidal nano silica (NS) on the mechanical properties of cement mortar has been investigated.Powdered NS (~40 nm) was synthesized by employing the sol gel method and compared with commercially available colloidal NS (~20 nm).SEM and XRD studies revealed that the powdered NS is non agglomerated and amorphous,while colloidal NS is agglomerated in nature.Introduction to modern mortars4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Dry ready to use mortar Dry ready to use mortar is cement and dried sand,sometimes with the addition of lime and or admixtures.It is stored on site in bags or bulk silos.The silos incorporate their own integral mixer and are connected to water and power supplies.This allows the mixing of the desired amount of mortar at any one time.1
