## Rutile: The titanium mineral in white paint and star ruby
What is Rutile? Rutile is a titanium oxide mineral with a chemical composition of TiO 2.It is found in igneous,metamorphic and sedimentary rocks throughout the world.Rutile also occurs as needle shaped crystals in other minerals.Rutile has a high specific gravity and is often concentrated by stream and wave action in “heavy mineral sands” that exist today in both onshore and offshore.Ilmenite Fe2+TiO330&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Ilmenite Fe2+TiO3 c 2005 Mineral Data Publishing,version 1 Crystal Data: Hexagonal.Point Group: 3.As thick tabular crystals,with dominant base,to rhombohedral,to 25 cm.Skeletal,granular,massive; as lamellar exsolutions in hematite or

## Ilmenite: An ore of titanium Uses and Properties
What is Ilmenite? Ilmenite is a common accessory mineral in igneous rocks,sediments,and sedimentary rocks in many parts of the world.Apollo astronauts found abundant ilmenite in lunar rocks and the lunar regolith.Ilmenite is a black iron titanium oxide with a chemical composition of FeTiO 3.Ilmenite is the primary ore of titanium,a metal needed to make a variety of high performance alloys.Ilmenite vs RutileIn context mineralogy lang=en terms the difference between ilmenite and rutile is that ilmenite is (mineralogy) a weakly magnetic dark gray mineral found in metamorphic and igneous rocks; it is a mixed oxide of iron and titanium,fetio 3 while rutile is (mineralogy) the most frequent of the three polymorphs of titanium dioxide,crystalizing in the tetragonal system,ti]][[oxygen o 2.

such as rutile,ilmenite,zircon and leucoxene from low density minerals such as quartz,clay,etc.This is followed by the magnetic separation to remove all the Fe bearing magnetic minerals from rutile and zircon which is then subsequently dried and heated toUpgrading ilmenite into a high grade synthetic rutile.Titanium,the ninth most abundant element,occurs mainly in minable form as ilmenite (95%) and rutile (5%) minerals.The current world consumption of these minerals is used mainly to produce titanium dioxide pigments,with the balance in welding rod flux and titanium metal.Ilmenite is currently being mined in annual quantities eight times larger than rutile.
