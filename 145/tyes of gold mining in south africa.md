## Here are the Types of Underground Mining.
The world’s deepest mine is the Mponeng gold mine in South Africa,which extends to a depth of almost 2&#189; miles below the Earth’s surface.Mining is a process of extracting minerals and metals from the Earth.These materials occur in their impure form,called ‘ores’,which are concentrated in certain regions in the form of ‘deposits’.Soil near mining sites ‘contaminated with heavy metals’The scoping phase involves Burkina Faso,Cameroon,Democratic Republic of Congo,Kenya,Namibia,Nigeria,Senegal,South Africa and Zambia.Felix Toteu,coordinator of the UNESCO project,says they expect that during the next four years,the project will cover more countries and more types of mine waste including coal,uranium,nickel,cobalt and oil.
