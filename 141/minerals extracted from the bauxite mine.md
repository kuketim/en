## How is Aluminium Extracted from Bauxite Ore
How Is Aluminium Extracted From Bauxite Ore? Did you know that aluminium as we know it is not found like this naturally? Even though this handy material is found in over 250 different mineral compounds,it has to be extracted from bauxite,an ore that is mined.Aluminum Minerals Education CoalitionBauxite is the name for a mixture of similar minerals that contain hydrated aluminum oxides.These minerals are gibbsite,diaspore,and boehmite.Bauxite forms when silica in aluminum bearing rocks (that is,rocks with a high content of the mineral feldspar) is

## Bauxite Mining The Australian Aluminium Council
Bauxite Mining Scrapers and small excavators are used to remove the remaining overburden and expose the caprock.Depending on the depth of the caprock,it can be broken by blasting,or simply removed with scrapers and excavators.The bauxite is then mined.(PDF) Availability of Bauxite ReservesBased upon a large database,this paper analyzes the record of bauxite mine production,exploration success,and resource depletion and evaluates the availability of bauxite reserves in the near.

## bauxite extraction
The mining industry of Guinea was developed during colonial rule.The minerals extracted consisted of iron,gold,diamond,and bauxite.Guinea ranks first in the world in bauxite reserves and 6th in the extraction of high grade bauxite,the aluminium ore.How are minerals obtained?Minerals are naturally occurring elements or compounds that have been formed through slow inorganic processes and occur in the earth’s crust.More than two thousand minerals have been identified and most of these are inorganic,which are formed by.
