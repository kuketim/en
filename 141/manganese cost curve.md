## Manganese(II) chloride
Manganese(II) chloride is the dichloride salt of manganese,MnCl2.This inorganic chemical exists in the anhydrous form,as well as the dihydrate (MnCl2&#183;2H2O) and tetrahydrate MnCl2&#183;4H2O),with the tetrahydrate being the most common form.Like many Mn(II) species,these salts are pink,with the paleness of the color being characteristic of.Pocket Colorimeter™ II,Manganese,Low Range Hach USA,The curve is generated by a point to point straight line segment between each standard used Linear and non linear positive or negative slope calibrations can be performed A calibration curve may also be manually entered from the keypad if a previously determined curve has been made on the Colorimeter
