## Bauxite: The principal ore of aluminum.
Bauxite is typically a soft material with a hardness of only 1 to 3 on the Mohs scale.It is white to gray to reddish brown with a pisolitic structure,earthy luster and a low specific gravity of between 2.0 and 2.5.These properties are useful for identifying bauxite; however,they have nothing to do with bauxite…How Aluminum is Produced29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The production of the metal Aluminum from the raw ore of Bauxite is a two stage process.Converting Bauxite to Alumina.STEP 1 Crushing and Grinding: Alumina recovery begins by passing the bauxite through screens to sort it by size.It is then crushed to produce relatively uniformly sized material.This materials is fed into a large.
