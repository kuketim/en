Cement Mill Overview.A cement mill is the equipment that used to grind the hard,nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement.Most cement is currently ground in ball mills.Cement clinker is usually ground using a cement ball mill.This is essentially a large rotating drum containing grinding media normally steel balls.Cement kilngrinding the resulting clinker to make cement (see Cement mill).In the second stage,the rawmix is fed into the kiln and gradually heated by contact with the hot gases from combustion of the kiln fuel.Successive chemical reactions take place as the temperature of the rawmix rises:
