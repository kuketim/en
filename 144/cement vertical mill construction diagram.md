## Manufacturing of Portland Cement Process and …
2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The manufacture of Portland cement is a complex process and done in the following steps: grinding the raw materials,mixing them in certain proportions depending upon their purity and composition,and burning them to sintering in a kiln at a temperature of about 1350 to 1500 ⁰C.During this process,these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by broking of chemical …Cement millA cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage) is the equipment used to grind the hard,nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement.Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more e
