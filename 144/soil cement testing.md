## Soil Stabilization Test on Cement &#187; Engineering Basic
The aim of soil stability test is to determine the effect of cement on OMC &amp; MDD of the given soil sample.Different soil samples exist with various dry and wet densities.After compaction,the voids are reduced and the density is increased.There exist certain soil type that do not meet up the required maximum density after compaction.Influence of coconut fibres and lime on the properties …1.Introduction.Soil cement mortar is a composite material which is mainly composed of soil and cement,and sometimes other additives.Duan and Zhang [] define soil cement as a composite material made of cement,soil,and other components.Cement lime mortar possesses good workability,good resistance against water,better bonding with units and good strength as compared with pure cement mortar.
