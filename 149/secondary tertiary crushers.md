## Crushers and Their Types IspatGuru
Types of crushers.Crushers are classified into three types based upon the stage of crushing they accomplish.These are (i) primary crusher,(ii) secondary crusher,and (iii) tertiary crusher.The primary crusher receives material directly from run of mine (ROM) afterSecondary Tertiary Crusher Saves Energy 20% Than Common.Mining tertiary crusher is an efficient,energy saving crushing equipment that can save energy 50% than traditional crushers.The tertiary stone crusher is also be called fine crusher.As the name suggests,it is a crusher for fine crushing and always used after coarse cr

## Cone Crusher
The secondary crushers are designated as Standard cone crushers having stepped liners and tertiary Short Head cone crushers,which have smoother crushing faces and steeper cone angles of the breaking head.The approximate distance of the annular space at the discharge end designates the size of the cone crushers.Stationary crushers and screensSandvik cone crushers are an excellent choice in secondary,tertiary,quaternary and pebble crushing applications.Stationary jaw crushers.Sandvik jaw crushers are of the single toggle type with advanced features for optimized performance,easy maintenance,long life and a low cost per ton.Sandvik stationary crushers and screens.
