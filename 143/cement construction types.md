Cement,in general,adhesive substances of all kinds,but,in a narrower sense,the binding materials used in building and civil engineering construction.Cements of this kind are finely ground powders that,when mixed with water,set to a hard mass.Setting and hardening result from hydration,which is a chemical combination of the cement compounds with water that yields submicroscopic.How to Choose the Right Mortar Mix: N,O,S,or MThere are four main types of mortar mix: N,O,S,and M.Each type is mixed with a different ratio of cement,lime,and sand to produce specific performance characteristics such as flexibility,bonding properties,and compressive strength.Type K mortar is rarely used for new construction but may be specified for restoration or other.
