## Liquefaction of unprocessed mineral ores
Unprocessed ores Iron ore fines and nickel ore There is a wide range of mineral cargoes that may liquefy,and they vary in their appearance and physical properties.One sub group of cargoes has a particularly dangerous combination of risk factors,and accounts for a large proportion of recent casualties,near misses and contentious load port disputes during carriage of cargoes that may liquefy.Iron Ore Processing for the Blast FurnaceIron Ore Processing for the Blast Furnace (Courtesy of the National Steel Pellet Company) The following describes operations at the National Steel Pellet Company,an iron ore mining and processing facility located on the Mesabi Iron Range of Minnesota.

## Concentration (Process)
The concentration process is then designed to produce a concentrate consisting predominantly of valuable mineral,with an accepted degree of locking with the gangue minerals,and a middlings fraction,which may require further grinding to promote optimumSinter Quality and Process of Sintering Iron Ores IspatGuruIn the sintering process,the above chemical reactions take place at high temperatures which results into the formation of a melting phase which is used during solid liquid reactions for assimilation and combining together of iron ore fines and fluxes.
