## Reinforced Concrete and Importance of Rebar
The structural elements in the buildings are having the internal forces namely compression,tension,bending moments and torsion.Withstanding these internal forces with low tendency for collapse and any undesirable deformation for serviceability condition is the main task of the construction materials.Concrete is generally preferable as a construction material over other alternatives as it.Cement Standards and Concrete StandardsASTM's cement and concrete standards are instrumental in the evaluation and testing of concrete,cement,and aggregates.Concrete can have different properties depending upon the mixture that is used in creating it,which contains cement,chemical admixtures,and aggregates.
