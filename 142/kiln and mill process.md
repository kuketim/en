## Lime Kiln Fundamentals Convergence Training
A lime kiln uses heat,motion,and airflow to convert lime mud to lime,or in chemical terms,calcium carbonate to calcium oxide This process is referred to as "calcining" The most common lime kiln designed found at kraft pulp mills is the rotary lime kilnHofmann EngineeringHofmann Engineering has a long and successful history of designing,manufacturing,installing and servicing mill and kiln parts.With a capability of manufacturing girth gears up to 15m (49ft) diameter and shells up to 13.4m (44ft) diameter,Hofmann Engineering is in.
