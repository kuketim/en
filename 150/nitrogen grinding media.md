## Grinding Linde Gas
The most widely accepted refrigerant for cryogrinding is liquid nitrogen ( C).Unlike CO 2,liquid nitrogen (LIN) does not go through a solid phase,instead transitioning directly to a gaseous state.LIN can thus be directly injected into a grinding mill.During theCryogenic grinding of thermoplastics and elastomersIn cold grinding,the materials to be ground are cooled and embrittled with cryogenic liquid nitrogen or carbon dioxide.Beim Kaltmahlen werden die zu mahlenden Materialien mit tiefkaltem,fl&#252;ssigem Stickstoff oder Kohlendioxid gek&#252;hlt und verspr&#246;det.
