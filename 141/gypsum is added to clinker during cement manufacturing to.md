## What is the effect of mixing gypsum with white cement?
During the cement manufacturing process,upon the cooling of clinker,a small amount of gypsum is introduced during the final grinding process.Gypsum is added to control the “setting of cement”.What is a cement clinker? AnswersDrivePortland cement clinker is ground to a fine powder and used as the binder in many cement products.A little gypsum is sometimes added.It may also be combined with other active ingredients or chemical admixtures to produce other types of cement including: ground granulated blast furnace slag cement.

## Portland cement Wikipedia
Manufacturing Portland cement clinker is made by heating,in a cement kiln,a mixture of raw materials to a calcining temperature of above 600 &#176;C (1,112 &#176;F) and then a fusion temperature,which is about 1,450 &#176;C (2,640 &#176;F) for modern cements,to sinter the materials into clinker The materials in cement clinker are alite,belite,tri calcium aluminate,and tetra calcium alumino ferriteCement: Materials and manufacturing processThe clinker is then cooled and ground to a fine powder in a tube or ball mill A ball mill is a rotating drum filled with steel balls of different sizes (depending on the desired fineness of the cement) that crush and grind the clinker Gypsum is added during the grinding process to provide means for controlling the setting of the cement

## Why is gypsum added to Portland cement
Portland Cement is made by baking limestone to remove the carbonate,and to this is added some gypsum (to provide sulphate) and diatomaceous earth (effectively a very finely divided silica).Cement Production Process Regain MaterialsCement is produced by mixing and fine grinding clinker,gypsum and mineral components (e.g.limestone,pozzolana,fly ash or granulated blast furnace slag,silica fume) in cement mills.Gypsum is added to control cement setting,i.e.the hardening process.
