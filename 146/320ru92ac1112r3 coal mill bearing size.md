## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotatiOptimization of mill performance by usingThe performance of tumbling mills is sensitive to the volumetric mill filling which influences grinding media wear rates,throughput,power draw,and product grind size from the circuit.Each of these performance parameters peaks at different filling values.In order to contin uously optimize mill operation,it is vital to
