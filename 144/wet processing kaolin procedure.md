## kaolin beneficiation china
The purpose of kaolin processing is to remove the sulfide,oxide and hydroxide of iron and titanium oxides which can reduce the whiteness of Kaolin,as well as the detrital minerals such as feldspar and quartz from the Kaolin ore,so as to improve the purity and whiteness of kaolin products.Kaolin beneficiation process mainly adopts gravity.REFINEMENT OF NIGERIAN KAOLIN BY WET PROCESSING AND …Kaolin was procured from miners in Alkaleri,Bauchi State situated at 10o ’48 oE and 9 88’ 98’ ’ N latitudes and Onibode in Ogun State situated at 3o 27’ E and 7o 7’ 60’ ’ N latitudes.2.2 Wet processing The crude kaolin samples were beneficiated by soaking
