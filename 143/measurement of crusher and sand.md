## An Investigation into the Use of Manufactured Sand as a.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;A sand equivalent (SE) test (BS EN 933 8:1999 on the 0 2 mm fraction) was also used,which evaluates the proportion of very fine and clay sized particles in the whole sample.Manufactured and crushed sands will usually have lower SE values than clean natural sands due to the dust of fracture created during the crushing process.How to Measure sand in a truck? A fully loaded lorry is.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;First measure Inner volume of Truck which has sand,Its Length x Breadth x Height in feet = cubicfeet.Then divide it by 100.For an example Saind measurement in feet is L 10 x B 5 x H 2 = 100 cubic feet.Then divide it by 100.So the Unit of sand is 1.
