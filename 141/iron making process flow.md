## The Making of Iron &amp; Steel
4 2 Materials Used to make Steel 2.1 Iron Ore Composition Iron very rarely occurs in the earth's surface as a metal.It is widely distributed,combined with oxygen as iron oxides.In fact it is believed that iron makes up about 5% by weight of the earth's crust.Blast Furnace Ironmaking&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Blast furnace productivity depends on the fuel efficiency and flow of materials and gases through the dry and wet zones of the furnace.The basis of the direct reduction process is that solid sponge iron is produced by removing oxygen from the ore in a shaft.

## Steelmaking
Steelmaking is the process of producing steel from iron ore and or scrap.In steelmaking,impurities such as nitrogen,silicon,phosphorus,sulfur and excess carbon (most important impurity) are removed from the sourced iron,and alloying elements such as manganese,nickel,chromium,carbon and vanadium are added to produce different grades of.12.5 Iron And Steel Production12.5 Iron And Steel Production 12.5.1 Process Description 3 The production of steel at an integrated iron and steel plant is accomplished using several interrelated processes.The major operations are: (1) coke production,(2) sinter production,(3) iron production.

## Direct reduced iron
Direct reduced iron (DRI),also called sponge iron,[1] is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps,pellets,or fines) to iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction.Direct reduction refers to solid state processes which reduce iron.Steel manufactureMaking iron [] Conversion to steel The basic raw material for steel manufacture is either the hot metal from the blast furnace,steel scrap or a mixture of both.The proportions of material used vary according to the process and the type of steel required.
