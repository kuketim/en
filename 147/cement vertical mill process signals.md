This is done by a mixture of both air cooling and water cooling,including spraying water inside the mill.Cement milling and gypsum dehydration.Because the cement gets hot due to the heat generated by grinding,gypsum can be partly dehydrated,forming hemihydrate,or plastCement grinding Vertical roller mills versus ball millscement industry the ball mill was really an epoch making breakthrough as for almost 80 years it was the predominant mill for grinding of raw materials and coal,and still today is the most used mill for cement grinding.Over the last three decades the vertical roller mill has become the preferred mill for grinding of raw materials.
