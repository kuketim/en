## The Mining Process Waihi Gold
1.Mining open pit and underground.To define the ore from the waste rock,samples are taken and assayed.Assay results are used to mark out areas of ore and waste rock,which are mined separately.Some of the harder areas require blasting to loosen the rock prior to excavation by hydraulic diggers.Mining of Iron Ores IspatGuruThese are surface mining and underground mining (sub surface mining).Iron ore is almost exclusively mined by surface operations.The most predominant surface mining methods used for mining of iron ores are open pit mining methods and open cut mining methods.However a few underground iron ore mines are also in operation around the globe.
