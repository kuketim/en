## Steel Slag
Slag processors may handle a variety of materials such as steel slag,ladle slag,pit slag,and used refractory material to recover steel metallics.These materials must be source separated,and well defined handling practices must be in place to avoid contamination of the steel slag aggregate.How do you figure how many yards of rock you need …This depends on how much rock you will use per square yard.Suppose you intend to use 1 100 tons (=20 lb) per square yard.Then if you have one ton of rock,it will cover 100 square yards.

## how much does basic slag cost ton? Yahoo Answers
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;some farm supply stores in my area sell it.they are all closed for the weekend now.cant call.i am trying to decide whether to use lime or basic slag on 2 fields that i have.It is a byproduct that otherwise costs money to dispose of,so in ton lots it ought only to cost.gravel vs.slag driveways which one is better? Yahoo …27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;I agree with yesiam,for her reason,and that slag actually is supposed to make the ground more fertile,because of it's micro nutrient content which actually help weeds grow under the slag.I am sure you want to avoid that.I am still not too sure about the safety to ground water either.
