## Why is limestone used in the iron extraction process.
 · limestone used as a flux which is used to remove impurities (such as silica (SiO2)) in the ore to forms a slag which melts and collects above the iron at the bottom of the furnace.if the impurities not removed,it would clog the furnace.Generation of iron and steel slag : NIPPON SLAG ASSOCIATIONWhile limestone may seem unrelated to the production of iron and steel,it actually is an essential auxiliary material that is added during the production process.During the process of reducing iron ore,it is necessary to remove the silica,alumina (Al2O3),and other non ferrous components contained in iron ore.The added&nbsp;.
