## Pulverizers 101: Part I
Pulverized coal mills with throats that are too wide will have corresponding low throat velocity in the mill grinding zone that contributes to excessive coal rejects and fires.This is an example.Coal mill pulverizer in thermal power plants&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;2.Coal pulverizer mill system One of the critical power plant components that is relied upon to convert the energy stored in coal into electricity is the coal pulverizer or mill.The coal flow is controlled by the feeder,allowing coal to flow into the pulverizer mill.The pulverized coal and air mixture is then transport to the boiler burner.
