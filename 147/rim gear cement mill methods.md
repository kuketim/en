## Cement kiln
Cement kilns are used for the pyroprocessing stage of manufacture of Portland and other types of hydraulic cement,in which calcium carbonate reacts with silica bearing minerals to form a mixture of calcium silicates.Over a billion tonnes of cement are made per year,and cement kilns are the heart of this production process: their capacity usually defines the capacity of the cement plant.Gear Technology magazine,The Journal of Gear.Gear Technology is where engineers and manufacturers come to find technical articles on gear design,engineering and manufacturing,and where the gear industry comes to locate suppl
