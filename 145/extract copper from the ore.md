A copper ore is a mixture of copper minerals and other materials in the rock called gangue,from which it is economically viable to extract the metal.A typical copper ore contains between 0.5% and 2.0% copper.A high grade ore produces a high yield of metal.A.Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper …Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.

## Is copper ore easy or difficult to extract
yes,it is quite easy to remove cu from its ore because cu is less reactive so less energy is required i.e.it can be removed from its ore by just heating its ore in air for two to three times.GCSE CHEMISTRY27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Extraction of Metals.Extraction of Copper.Copper is sometimes found as native metal.Copper ores include copper(II) oxide and copper(II) sulfide.Copper(II) oxide can be reduced by reaction with carbon.Some copper ores may contain only small amounts of copper.These are called low grade ores and have less than 1% copper but they are still used because copper is so valuable.
