## Dual roll crushers,how they function
Roll crushers have a theoretical MAXIMUM reduction ratio of 4:1.If a 2 inch particle is fed to the roll crusher the absolute smallest size one could expect from the crusher is 1 2 inch.Roll crushers will only crush material down to a minimum particle size of about 10 Mesh (2 mm).A roll crusher crushes using compression,with two rolls.Roll CrushersRoll Crushers are compression type crushers,and were once widely used in mining.They have,within the last 10 or so years,fallen into dis favor among mining and processing companies.The probable reason is because the large mines require very large crushed product output with minimal cost,makes the roll crusher uncompetitive.
