## On early Mechanical Properties of Artificial Sand …
This paper studies the early mechanical properties of artificial sand concrete,we found by comparison with natural sand concrete that the slump of artificial sand concrete were increased by 85%,and the strength 0f 16h and 1d and3d were increased by 23.4% and 20% and 11%.Therefore,artificial sand can significantly improve the workability of concrete mix,improve the early strength of concrete.Properties of Concrete by Replacement of Natural Sand …Artificial sand generally contain more angular particles with rough surface textures and flatter face than natural sand that are more rounded as a result of weathering.Over the time some investigations have shown that angular particles,rough surface of artificial sand influences the workability and finish ability in fresh concrete.
