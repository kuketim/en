## Rod mills,how they function
Rod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition,Metal Rolling and Drawing GanoksinThe process of reducing rod shaped ingots to wire is similar to the sheet process just described,because the forces of rolling are almost identical.As before,the rod should be forged with a hammer and annealed to prepare the crystal structure for rolling.When this is done,the rod is inserted into a large groove in the wire rolling mill and given a light pass to insure a ?at surface.The.

the wire rod mill of the Kamaishi Works,endless rolling was introduced to the multi strand rolling mill for the first time in the world for improving productivity and yield,as well as for reducing customer work load by supplying heavy weight coils.* Manager,Head of Section,Wire Rod Mill,Production Div.Kamaishi Works 23 15 Suzuko cho.Rolling (metalworking)The invention of the rolling mill in Europe may be attributed to Leonardo da Vinci in his drawings.The earliest rolling mills in crude form but the same basic principles were found in Middle East and South Asia as early as 600 BCE.Earliest rolling mills were slitting mills,which were introduced from what is now Belgium to England in 1590.
