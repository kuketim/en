## Aggregates
Aggregates are inert granular materials such as sand,gravel,or crushed stone that,along with water and portland cement,are an essential ingredient in concrete.For a good concrete mix,aggregates need to be clean,hard,strong particles free of absorbed.Section III: Surface Gravel14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;aggregate is used? It is a good practice to test the aggregate before placing it on the road.Also,if the tests fail,you can work with the crushing contractor to try to blend and improve or reject the material.This becomes even more critical in producing material for pavement or base.Sampling Another issue critical to testing

It is a good practice to test the aggregate before placing it on the road.Also,if the tests fail,you can work with the crushing contractor to try to blend and improve or reject the material.This becomes even more critical in producing material for pavement or base.Sampling Another issue critical to testingPavement materials: AggregatesImpact test The aggregate impact test is carried out to evaluate the resistance to impact of aggregates.Aggregates passing 12.5 mm sieve and retained on 10 mm sieve is filled in a cylindrical steel cup of internal dia 10.2 mm and depth 5 cm which is attached to a metal base of impact testing machine.
