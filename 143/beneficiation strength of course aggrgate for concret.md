## The Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete
2000 3 30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete Concrete is a mixture of cementious material,aggregate,and water.Aggregate is commonly considered inert filler,which accounts for 60 to 80 percent of the volume and 70 to 85 percent of the weight of concrete.Different Types & Sizes of Aggregate for Concrete. · When the aggregate is sieved through 4.75mm sieve,the aggregate retained is called coarse aggregate.Gravel,cobble and boulders come under this category.The maximum size aggregate used may be dependent upon some conditions.In general,40mm size aggregate used for normal strengths and 20mm size is used for high strength concrete.
