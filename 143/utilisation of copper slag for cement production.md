## Utilization of copper slag in cement and concrete.
Copper slag is a by product obtained during matte smelting and refining of copper.The common management options for copper slag are recycling,recovering of metal,production of value added products such as abrasive tools,roofing granules,cutting tools,abrasive,tiles,glass,road base construction,railroad ballast,asphalt pavements.Articles on the slag industry from Global Slag2019 12 27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The copper slag has been found to contain high iron oxide and may be used as a source of iron in the manufacture of OPC.However,the presence of high iron in the slag hinders its bulk utilisation.The effect of copper present in the copper slag is invisible in the formation of clinker as the quantity of copper slag used in the raw mix for OPC.
