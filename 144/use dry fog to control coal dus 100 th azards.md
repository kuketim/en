## Experimental Investigation of Coal Dust Wettability Based …
Wettability is one of the key chemical properties of coal dust,which is very important to dedusting.In this paper,the theory of liquid wetting solid was presented firstly; then,taking the gas coal of Xinglongzhuang coal mine in China as an example,by determination of critical surface tension of coal piece,it can be concluded that only when the surface tension of surfactant solution is.Use Dry Fog to Control Coal Dust HazardsUse Dry Fog to Control Coal Dust Hazards Fogging systems have been successfully used in the material handling industry for more than 30 years to control explosive dust at transfer points.
