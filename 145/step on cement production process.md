## Cement Clinker Calcination in Cement Production …
The cement clinker calcination is an important step in the cement production process.It mainly occurs in cement kiln and can be roughly divided into six reaction stages,namely drying,preheating,chemical decomposition,exothermic reaction,sintering and cooling.Manufacturing process Lafarge in South Africa7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;From the limestone quarry to the delivery of the end product,follow every step in the cement manufacturing process.Step 1: extraction of raw materials The raw materials needed to produce cement (calcium carbonate,silica,alumina and iron ore) are generally extracted from limestone rock,chalk,clayey schist or clay.

## Cement production and cooling
Cement cooling is an important step in the cement production process,as it reduces the chance of gypsum dehydration and the formation of lumps,reducing the overall quality of the final cement.The end users of cement are also demanding lower cement.Cement ProductionCement Production Cement production is an energy intensive industrial process that requires heat to be supplied at high temperature levels under the constraints of gas solid heat exchange phenomena and the kinetics of chemical reactions.From: Computer Aided Chemical Engineering,2013
