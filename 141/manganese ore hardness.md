## PRODUCTION,IMPORTORT,USE,AND DISPOSAL ,
53 USE Metallic manganese (ferromanganese) is used principally in steel production to improve hardness,stiffness,and strength It is used in carbon steel,stainless steel,high temperature steel,and tool steel,along with cast iron and superalloys (EPA 1984; NAS 1973)According to data obtained from the US Geological Society (USGS),manganese ore was consumed primarily by eight firms.Manganese: Nodules,Uses,Facts,Ore,Alloys,MetalIn its supply condition high manganese steel has a hardness of approximately 200HB and an approximate tensile strength of 880 N mm&#178; Manganese Steel with a 11% to 14% manganese content is a work hardening steel.With its high carbon (approximately 1.2%.

## manganese Uses,Facts,& Compounds Britannica
Manganese (Mn),chemical element,one of the silvery white,hard,brittle metals of Group 7 (VIIb) of the periodic tableIt was recognized as an element in 1774 by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele while working with the mineral pyrolusite and was isolated the same year by his associate,Johan Gottlieb GahnAlthough it is rarely used in pure form,manganese is essential to steelmakingThe Properties and Effects of Manganese as an Alloying ElementEffects of Manganese as an Alloying Element Manganese is used as an alloying element for many different applications Manganese is a key component of steel In fact,this chemical element is present in all commercially available steels and is responsible for the steel’s hardness and strength,but to less of an extent than carbon

## manganese
[1913 Webster +PJC] Note: An alloy of manganese with iron (called ferromanganese) is used to increase the density and hardness of steel.[ 1913 Webster ] { Black oxide of manganese },{ Manganese dioxide } or { Manganese peroxide },or { Black manganese } ( Chem.),a heavy black powder { MnO2 },occurring native as the mineral pyrolusite,and valuable as a strong oxidizer ; …Chemistry of ManganeseThe hardness property of manganese helped them to create strong equipment for war.Furthermore,humans have been using manganese compounds centuries before human civilization began.The history of Manganese usage traces back to the stone age era,where nomads used it as a pigment to decorate their caves and sacred places.
