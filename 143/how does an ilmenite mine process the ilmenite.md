## Mining Madagascar
Madagascar is the fourth biggest island in the world with abundant amount of mineral resources,especially ilmenite,nickel and bauxite.Ilmenite is globally used material that is contained in wide range,from toothpaste to paints.The discovery of the island’s potential for profit in mining industry drew global attention to invest and the Madagascar government did not miss this opportunity.Ilmenite for pigment and metal productionRutile is easy to process to titanium metal or TiO2 pigment by the chlorination method while ilmenite is more complicated because of its high iron content.Since the world reserves of titanium are 90% in the form of ilmenite and only 10% in the form of rutile,the treatment of ilmenite is evidently an important question in metallurgy [1,2].

Ilmenite is the principal source of titanium in China with rutile making up very little of the total.Around 108 mine fields across 21 provinces,autonomous regions and municipalities have found titanium resources,with Panxi in Sichuan,Chengdu in Hebe,along with others in Yunnan,Hainan,Guangxi and Guangdong the most prominent.Sibelco5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Our mineral sands portfolio includes ilmenite,rutile and zircon.Ilmenite is blended and processed to create titanium dioxide used in the production of paints and cosmetics.Rutile is used to produce titanium dioxide pigments,flux core welding wire and titanium metals.Zircon is used mainly in the ceramics industry.

## Ilmenite smelting: the basics T
In ilmenite smelting,the iron content of the oxide is also lowered by reduction to metallic iron,but this takes place in the liquid state,at a much higher temperature (of around 1650&#176;C).Ilmenite smelting thus yields two products: a titania rich slag,and molten iron.Flotability Improvement of Ilmenite Using Attrition.Flotation technology of the recovery and utilization of ilmenite from tailings of iron beneficiated in Panzhihua was investigated based on mineralogical study.The results of mineralogical study show that the main occurrence of the valuable mineral are liberated grains of ilmenite.Experimental results of flotation conditions show that attrition scrubbing raw ores exhibit good flotability with.
