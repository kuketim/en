## The Process for Making Portland Cement
The Process for Making Portland Cement Materials that contain appropriate amounts of calcium compounds,silica,alumina and iron oxide are crushed and screened and placed in a rotating cement kiln.Ingredients used in this process are typically materials such as limestone,sandstone,marl,shale,iron,clay,and fly ash.What Is Fly Ash Cement? (with pictures)&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Fly ash cement is a primary ingredient in certain concretes that is often used as an alternative to Portland cement,which is a more traditional concrete base.The ash itself is a byproduct of coal combustion,but once formed into a cement the ash usually binds in such a way as to neutralize many of the chemicals and toxins that have made coal burning so controversial in recent years.
