## AMIT 135: Lesson 8 Rod Mills Mining Mill Operator Training
Rods are placed parallel along the length of the rod mill.Rods are 150mm shorter than the mill length.Breakage occurs more from cascading than cateracting.The product size distribution is narrower than a ball mill but significantly coarser.Most are overflow discharge type.Length to diameter= 1.4 to 2.3.Mill length = 7 meters.Patterson IndustriesThe Continuous Ball and Pebble Mill grinding units range from 24&quot; (610 mm) diameter to 96&quot; (2438 mm) diameter and from 36&quot; (915 mm) long to 36'0&quot; (11 m) long.PATTERSON's unmatched Ball and Pebble Mill custom design experience and manufacturing capability is your assurance of a system that meets your requirement for maximum grinding efficiency.
