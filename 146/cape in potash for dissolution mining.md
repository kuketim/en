## INTRODUCTION TO MINING
INTRODUCTION TO MINING 1.1 MINING’S CONTRIBUTION TO CIVILIZATION Mining may well have been the second of humankind’s earliest endeavors— granted that agriculture was the ﬁrst.The two industries ranked together as the primary or basic industries of early civilization.Little has changed in theMining Potash for FertilizerPotash,pronounced pot ash,is the term commonly used to describe potassium containing salts used as fertilizer.Most potash is derived from potassium chloride (KCl),which is also known as Muriate of Potash (MOP).As a source of soluble potassium,potash is vital to the agricultural industry as a.

## Amenability of Potash Ore for Solution Mining
mining differs from heap and vat leaching as it does not involve conventional mining of the ore.Minerals such as potash,trona (raw soda ash),etc.are readily soluble in water thus they could be suitable for solution mining.In case of these minerals,solution mining targets the dissolution of the so called “evaporates” fraction,Processing of potash oreThe potash ores are the main raw material used to produce potash and compound fertilizers and other chemicals.The potash ore generally consists of sylvite (KCl),halite (NaCl the rock forming mineral) containing the inclusions of carnalite,anhydrite and silicate and carbonate (insoluble residue).

The advantages of solar salt production are many,including dissolution rates.Intrepid’s solar salt comes in a variety of grades and moisture levels appropriate for animal feed,de icing,oil &amp; gas drilling and completions,water softening,hide processing and chlor alkali production.MiningMining Solution mining: Natural brine wells are the source of a large percentage of the world’s bromine,lithium,and boron and lesser amounts of potash,trona (sodium carbonate),Glauber’s salt (sodium sulfate),and magnesium.In addition,artificial brines are produced by dissolving formations containing soluble minerals such as halite (rock salt; sodium chloride),potash,trona,and.
