## The hardness of grinding media ball
From the way the ball mill works.In the operation environment,the ball mill is divided into two types: wet ball mill and dry ball mill.Dry Ball millwork has a strong corrosion,so as the same wear resistant grinding media ball,the wear resistant grinding media ball in the wet grinding efficiency is faster.Dry GrindingNETZSCH Ecutec produces an array of grinding technologies including ball mills,pin mills,air classifier mills,jet mills and roller mills.Each type of mill has its own set of parameters and considerations and NETZSCH Ecutec&#180;s engineers have the expertise to recommend the right mill for each application.
