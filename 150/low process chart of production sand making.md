2020 2 7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Sand casting is a process that utilizes non reusable sand molds to form metal castings.It is a common production method for metal components of all sizes,from a few ounces to several tons.Sand casting isn’t only versatile in the size of its products it can also create exceptionally complex or detailed castings,and can be used to cast nearly any metal alloy.Different Types of Casting Processes used in …Sand casting's main advantages as a casting process include: Relatively inexpensive production costs,especially in low volume runs.The ability to fabricate large components.A capacity for casting both ferrous and non ferrous materials.A low cost for post casting tooling. Disadvantages of Sand Casting

## Iron Ore Processing for the Blast Furnace
3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Iron Ore Processing for the Blast Furnace (Courtesy of the National Steel Pellet Company) The following describes operations at the National Steel Pellet Company,an iron ore mining and processing facility located on the Mesabi Iron Range of Minnesota.Creating steel from low grade iron ore requires a long process of mining,crushing,Aluminium alloy wheels manufacturing process,…The first high volume production of sheet wheels in Europe started in 1979 for Daimler Benz cars destined for the USA.Through further development of the production process for wheel rims and naves,the manufacturing costs were reduced markedly so that an aluminium sheet wheel has been produced in large numbers for the BMW 5 Series since 1995

## Metal casting processes
2016 2 29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The six basic steps in making sand castings are,(i) Pattern making,(ii) Core making,(iii) Moulding,(iv) Melting and pouring,(v) Cleaning Pattern making Pattern: Replica of the part to be cast and is used to prepare the mould cavity.It is the physical model of the casting used to make the mould.Made of either wood or metal.Steps in the Modern Steelmaking ProcessThe Modern Steel Production Process.(BOS) and electric arc furnaces (EAF),account for virtually all steel production.﻿ ﻿ Ironmaking,the first step in making steel,involves the raw inputs of iron ore,coke,and lime being melted in a blast furnace.The resulting molten iron—also referred to as hot metal—still contains 4.5%.

## Sand Casting Process,Defects,Design
Sand casting,the most widely used casting process,utilizes expendable sand molds to form complex metal parts that can be made of nearly any alloy.Because the sand mold must be destroyed in order to remove the part,called the casting,sand casting typically has a low production rate.The sand casting process involves the use of a furnace.
