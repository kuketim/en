## A study of the reaction of hydrated lime with pure clay (kaolin) in …
ABSTRACT The work presented is the investigation of the reaction of pure Kaolinite clay with hydrated lime in clay stabilisation.Pure Kaolin olay,ranging from one micron to five microns in size,was mixed with calcium hydroxide in the form of a paste.'l'heseHow to ensure energy efficiency in miningIn hard rock applications the designer may favour a design that incorporates more crushing upstream of an HPGR (high pressure grinding roll) circuit for energy efficiency.In cases where there are a lot of clays present or there is high moisture,an AG (autogenous grinding) or SAG (semi autogenous grinding) mill may be appropriate.
