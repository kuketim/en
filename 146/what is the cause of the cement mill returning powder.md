## What is the Difference Between Concrete and Cement?
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The primary difference between concrete and cement is that concrete is a composite material made of water,aggregate,and cement.Cement is a very fine powder made of limestone and other minerals,which absorbs water and acts as a binder to hold the concrete together.While cement is a construction material in its own right,concrete cannot be made without cement.Cement millA cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage) is the equipment used to grind the hard,nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement.Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.

## Cement,How It Is Produced
Cement,or Portland cement,is defined as &quot;a hydraulic cement,obtained by burning a mixture of lime and clay to form a clinker,then pulverizing the clinker into powder.The greenish gray powder is composed primarily of calcium silicates,calcium aluminates,and calcium ferrites.The influence of the separator on the output of the mill.And can prevent the fine powder in the grinding adhesion caused by the buffering effect,improve the grinding efficiency of the mill,adjust the composition of particles,prevent the phenomenon of non uniform fine powder,so the powder separator can ensure the quality of grinding,improve the output of the mill.
