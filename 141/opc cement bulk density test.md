## Ground granulated blast furnace slag Wikipedia
Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS or GGBFS) is obtained by quenching molten iron slag (a by product of iron and steel making) from a blast furnace in water or steam,to produce a glassy,granular product that is then dried and ground into a fine powderSpecific Gravity of Cement Detailed Explanation CivilologyIf the cement has exposed to extreme moisture content then,the specific gravity of cement will differ because of the moisture content present in the por Every material has solid particles and pores which may contain water in it Normally our nominal mix design is based on the value of specific gravity of cement as 315 The value will.
