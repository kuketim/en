## Rock Crushing Rule of Thumb
Nearly all crushers produce a product that is 40% finer than one half the crusher setting.Source: Babu and Cook; The product of a jaw crusher will have a size distribution such that the 80% fraction size (d80) is slightly less than the open side setting of the crusher.For example,if the open side setting is 6 inches,the d80 product size will be 5&#190; inches.Introduction to Rock Crushers&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;As a basic rule,jaw crushers are the primary crusher taking the mined aggregate and reducing it to a size that a cone crusher can accept.Cone crushers tend to be the secondary crusher,and usually produce material of a size needed for many industry applications such as the aggregates needed for asphalt and concrete production.
