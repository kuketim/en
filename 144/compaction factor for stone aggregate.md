## 57 Stone Compaction
&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;No.57 stone is an easily consolidated material but it is not self consolidating.Uncompacted or dumper deposits of No.57 stone can settle about 1″ per foot of thickness.No.57 stone should be placed in lifts and consolidated using conventional compaction techniques.The Importance of Aggregate Correction Factors in Air.Aggregate correction factor determination should be a part of routine testing,just like correction factors determined for ignition oven testing (AASHTO T 308 ASTM D6307).The first step to avoiding this nonconformity is to ensure that the laboratory’s training program contains procedures and training guidelines for this process.
