## The Different Soil Horizons Explained in the Simplest Way.
It is poor in mineral and clay content as these are lost to the lower layers in the process of leaching and therefore,it is also called the layer of eluviation (leaching).The soil particles of this layer are larger in size than those in the A horizon,but smaller than those in the underlying B horizon.Desert Soils Arizona Sonora Desert MuseumThe great contrast in the amount of time over which the soils have developed is responsible for the differences in soil characteristics.Soil Layers: Clay,Colors,and Caliche.Many soils of the piedmonts and basin floors of the Sonoran Desert start out as deposits of gravelly or stony alluvium which have fairly uniform characteristics throughout.With the passage of time,however,pronounced.

## Aquifer Wikipedia
An aquifer is an underground layer of water bearing permeable rock,rock fractures or unconsolidated materials (gravel,sand,or silt).Groundwater can be extracted using a water well.The study of water flow in aquifers and the characterization of aquifers is called hydrogeology.Related terms include aquitard,which is a bed of low permeability along an aquifer,and aquiclude (or aquifuge.understanding groundwater &amp; wells UnicefThe clay particles of the clay layer that you have encountered during drilling may have arrived from.In fact,knowing the characteristics of the soil is even.

## Four Layers of Soil Eco Kids
Each layer has its own characteristics that make it different from all of the other clay and mineral deposits and less organic materials than the layers above it.Clay WikipediaClay minerals typically form over long periods of time as a result of the gradual chemical weathering of rocks,usually silicate bearing,by low concentrations of carbonic acid and other diluted solvents.These solvents,usually acidic,migrate through the weathering rock after leaching through upper weathered layers.In addition to the weathering process,some clay minerals are formed through.
