Gold recovery improved from 92% to 98% with two solution changes.The presence of carbon in leach process (CIL) was shown to achieve a similar gold recovery.Lead nitrate was shown to be beneficial in reducing residue grades in all cases.Fine grinding of the concentrate to 22 mm with CIL leaching improved recovery further to 98.6%.The leaching and adsorption behaviour of gold ores28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;effects.Diagnostic leaching was used to show that mineralogy was not an important factor in the enhanced gold extraction in the presence of activated carbon for the ores.Kinetic models were developed for the leaching of gold from the ore,adsorption onto activated carbon and preg robbing at the ore surface.A variable order empirical

## Leaching in Metallurgy and Metal Recovery
26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Heap leaching technology is important to the future of metal recovery,since it can be applied to extract precious and base metals sitting in abandoned tailings,and or waste management sites.With emerging technologies and development requiring more of our natural resources,near 100% recovery becomes extremely important.Thiourea Gold Leaching Metallurgist & Mineral Processing.Research on the leaching of gold by thiourea has been reported extensively in the literature,but research on the recovery of gold from leach solutions has not been well documented.Some methods for recovering gold thiourea complex reported in the current literature include electrochemical,activated carbon adsorption,ion exchange adsorption.
