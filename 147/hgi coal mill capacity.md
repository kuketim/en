## Coil Pulverizers for Boilers
A higher Hardgrove index indicates the coal is easier to grind.50 HGI normally is taken for calculating the base capacity of the mill.When coal with HGI higher than 50 is fed to the pulverizer,the output will be higher than base capacity,and below 50 HGI,the output will be lower.The total moistureUNIT 1 HARDGROVE GRINDABILITY INDEXUNIT 1 HARDGROVE GRINDABILITY INDEX (continued) Conversely at a constant HGI the fineness of the product varies with mill capacity.Below rated capacity the mill produces coal with a higher proportion less than 75 microns and above rated capacity it produces coal with a lower proportion less than 75 microns.FiGure 4 Product fineness vs mill.
