## Processes and Procedures in the Extraction of Iron.
The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process.The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace.These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyeres.How Will You Extract Iron From Its Ore SolutionHow will you extract iron from its ore solution extraction of iron extraction of iron from haematitehe process of the extraction of iron is carried out by the following steps concentration of ore calcination or roasting of ore reduction of ore concentration of ore in this
