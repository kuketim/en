&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;At the present time,the slump of concrete is measured by sampling the batch and checking the slump of the few shovels full in the sample by means of a conventional slump cone.Unfortunately,the cone is not very accurate and the sampling process leaves much to be desired inasmuch as it is not necessarily fully representative of the batch and is basically a laboratory test.CONCRETE 1019&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Slump is a measure of concrete consistency or fluidity.Consistency is the ability of freshly mixed concrete to flow.For given proportions of cement and aggregates (without admixtures),the higher the slump,the wetter the mix.Four inch (4”) slump is very common with normal weight concrete and is a good average slump for pumping.

## Concrete Slump Test for Workability Procedure and Results
The slump test is the most simple workability test for concrete,involves low cost and provides immediate results.Due to this fact,it has been widely used for workability tests since 1922.The slump is carried out as per procedures mentioned in ASTM C143 in the United States,IS: 1199 1959 in India and EN 2 in Europe.Why should a slump meter use a watt transducer instead of,13 06 2020&#0183;&#32;There are two good reasons why your concrete mixer slump meter should use a watt transducer and not just measure Amps: An Ammeter (or electrical current meter) measures the current drawn by your mixer motor during mixing of a full batch of concrete

HunkerConcrete is traditionally made out of a mixture of cement,water,sand and gravel.Modern concrete mixes also add other ingredients such as fibers,plastics and various chemical admixtures.The ingredients and the mixture proportion determine the properties of concrete,including slump.
