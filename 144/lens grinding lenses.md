## How eyeglass lens is made
The convex lens was the first optical lens used in glasses to aid the correction of farsightedness,but other corrective lenses followed,including the concave lens for the correction of near sightedness,and more complex lenses for the correction of astigmatism,as well as the invention of bifocals by Benjamin Franklin in 1784.US6095896AAn eyeglass lens grinding machine is provided in which a bevel can be easily formed on the periphery of an eyeglass lens in such a manner that those portions of the lens which will protrude from either the front or rear surface of an eyeglass frame are appropriately adjusted in areas where the edge thickness is great in order to achieve a good aesthetic appeal after the lens has been fitted in.

## What Does a Lens Grinder Do? (with pictures)
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Glass and plastic lenses are most common,and the lens grinder will need to learn how to work with each material safely and effectively.The grinder will learn how to mark lenses to indicate where cutting and grinding must occur,and he or she will also learn how to polish the lenses to eliminate scratches,clouding,and other damage that can obscure regular vision.Axis Lens Grinding Machine: 150 mm Optics OptiProThe eSX 150 lens grinding machine has 5 controllable axes: X,Y,Z,B &amp; C with up to 5 axes of simultaneous movement.The powerful Fagor 8070 CNC with user friendly G Series software make the eSX 150 optical machining center an excellent choice for prototype to production manufacturing of precision optics up to 150mm.
