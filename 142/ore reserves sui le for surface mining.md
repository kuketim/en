## Mining
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth,usually from an ore body,lode,vein,seam,reef or placer deposit.These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.Ores recovered by mining include metals,coal,oil shale,gemstones,limestone,chalk,dimension.252 Extracting ores Mining of mineral resources SiyavulaRocks with large concentrations of minerals,are called or Mining depends on finding good quality ore,preferably within a small area The next step is to get the rocks which contain the mineral out of the ground Once the ore is on the surface,the process of getting the mineral you want out of the rock can start

## Surface mining
Surface mining,including strip mining,open pit mining and mountaintop removal mining,is a broad category of mining in which soil and rock overlying the mineral deposit (the overburden) are removed,in contrast to underground mining,in which the overlying rock is left in place,and the mineral is removed through shafts or tunnels.Surface.MiningMining Mining Prospecting and exploration: Various techniques are used in the search for a mineral deposit,an activity called prospecting.Once a discovery has been made,the property containing a deposit,called the prospect,is explored to determine some of.

Copper ore is mined in the X41 and Enterprise underground mines using traditional sub level open stoping methods.Once the ore is loosened by drilling and blasting,it is mucked,crushed and hauled to the surface where it is put through the concentrating process.mining TheFreeDictionaryUnder certain circumstances surface mining can become prohibitively expensive and underground mining may be considered A major factor in the decision to operate by underground mining rather than surface mining is the strip ratio,or the number of units of waste material in a surface mine that must be removed in order to extract one unit of ore

## Mining
Mining Mining Surface mining: It has been estimated that more than two thirds of the world’s yearly mineral production is extracted by surface mining.There are several types of surface mining,but the three most common are open pit mining,strip mining,and.Opinion: Midwater ecosystems must be considered when,Jul 28,2020&#0183;&#32;Mining strategies will vary significantly between mineral resource types and perhaps between contractors,but they will involve some combination of seafloor collector vehicle with a vertical transport system to carry the ore and sediments to a surface vessel,shipboard separation of ore bearing materials (dewatering),and subsequent discharge.

## Coal National Geographic Society
Surface Mining If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground,it can be extracted through surface mining In surface mining,workers simply remove any overlying sediment,vegetation,and rock,called overburden Economically,surface mining is a cheaper option for extracting coal than underground miningLibro in distribuzione: "Le Cetine di Cotorniano,"History of mining at “Le Cetine” Mining operations for antimony ore extraction at Le Cetine covers a time span of 72 years,from 1878 to 1949; during this time interval the mine produced 61,215 tons of antimony ore Part of the activity was carried out as surface mining and part as underground works

## What are the main methods of mining? American,
There are four main mining methods: underground,open surface (pit),placer,and in situ mining Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels,beach sands,or other,A Review of Nickel,Copper,and Cobalt Recovery by,Nov 09,2018&#0183;&#32;Chile has also the largest amount of copper ore reserves (210 Mt),followed by Australia (89 Mt) and Peru (81 Mt) One tenth of mineral reserves of copper in the world is from Copperbelt,localized in Zambia and Democratic Republic of Congo,and studies show several socio environmental problems of these mines [72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81]

Andrew P Schissler,in Encyclopedia of Energy,2004 23 Strip Mining Strip mining is employed in coal reserves where the overburden is removed in rectangular blocks in plan view called pits or strips The pits are parallel and adjacent to each other Strip mining is fundamentally different from contour or area mining on how the overburden is displaced,
