## The Balance
Methods for manufacturing steel have evolved significantly since industrial production began in the late 19th century.Modern methods,however,are still based on the same premise as the original Bessemer Process,which uses oxygen to lower the carbon contentWrought ironWrought iron has been used for many centuries,and is the &quot;iron&quot; that is referred to throughout Western history.The other form of iron,cast iron,was in use in China since ancient times but was not introduced into Western Europe until the 15th century; even then,due to its brittleness,it could be used for only a limited number of purposes.
