## Bauxite
Alumina refineries are now sited close to bauxite mines,to minimize transportation costs; in the past they were built close to the aluminum smelters to avoid the risk of nationalization and levies.Two tonnes of bauxite yields one tonne of alumina.Organic compounds in the processing of lateritic bauxites …This review is the first of a series examining the history and current state of knowledge of the science related to organic compounds in the Bayer process for the extraction of alumina from lateritic bauxites.Part 1 covers the origins,nature and chemistry of organic.

## Aluminas
Thus,bauxite and other aluminum containing minerals such as kaolinite (\(Al 4Si 4O {10}(OH) 8\)) must be mined and processed to produce pure alumina.Australia produces about $3 billion worth of alumina a year from six Australian refineries.Synthesis of High Surface Area Alumina Aerogels without …Alumina aerogels were prepared through the addition of propylene oxide to aqueous or ethanolic solutions of hydrated aluminum salts,AlCl 3 &#183;6H 2 O or Al(NO 3) 3 &#183;9H 2 O,followed by drying with supercritical CO 2.This technique affords low density (60−130 kg m 3),high surface area (600−700 m 2 g) alumina aerogel monoliths without the use of alkoxide precursors.
