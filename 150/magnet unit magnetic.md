## Tesla (unit)
The tesla (symbol: T) is a derived unit of the magnetic induction (also,magnetic flux density) in the International System of Units.One tesla is equal to one weber per square metre.The unit was announced during the General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960 and is named[1] in honour of Nikola Tesla,upon the proposal of the.Magnetic Flux Unit ConverterWe use rounding at unit conversion.info.This means that some results will be rounded to avoid the numbers getting too long.While often rounding works up to a specific decimal place,we’ve decided that limiting the length of the result to 13 digits would be more.
