## Casing String
Once the cement has set,the quality of the bonds to the casing and formation,uniformity of the cement sheath,and strength of the cement can be assessed using downhole logging tools (cement bond logging or cement evaluation tools).Figure 16.3 shows an example of a suite of cement evaluation log results.A representation of the integrity of the cement job,especially whether the cement is adhering solidly to the outside of the casing.The log is typically obtained from one of a variety of sonic type tools.The newer versions,called cement evaluation logs,along with their processing software,can give detailed,degree representations of the integrity of the cement job,whereas older.Cement Evaluation SchlumbergerCement placement is a critical component of the well architecture for ensuring mechanical support of the casing,protection from fluid corrosion,isolation of permeable zones at different pressure regimes to prevent hydraulic communication,and effective plug and abandonment operations.It also covers the logging tools and technologies use to evaluate the integrity of the cement prior to initial completion or anytime during the life of the well.The first day of class is dedicated to evaluating cement and the second day to repairs.Learning Level.Intermediate to Advanced.Course Length
