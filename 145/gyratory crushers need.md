## Gyratory Crusher
A gyratory crusher is an ore processing machine that crushes the ore between an eccentrically mounted cone and a crushing throat that is fixed.In mining,the most important criteria for effective crushing of oresis to choose the type of crusher that suits the rock (ore) material and to ensure uniform feed.Gyratory and Cone CrusherPrimary crushers are solidly built to receive large lumps of rock directly from the mines and designed for large tonnage throughputs.Basically,gyratory crushers consist of a fixed solid conical shell or bowl (also called concaves) and a solid cone within the bowl called a breaking head (Figure 5.1).The breaking head is fixed to a central spindle,which is hydraulically suspended or.

Cone crushers are built with a rotating mantle in a concave bowl lined with manganese—this is similar to gyratory crushers,but the crushing chamber in cone crushers is not as steeply angled.Cone crushers can accept medium hard to very hard and abrasive feeds that might be dry or wet,though not sticky (whereas gyratory crushers are better at handling softer,dryer feeds).Gyratory Crushers4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Gyratory Crushers.The primary rock breaker most commonly used in large plants is the gyratory crusher,of which a typical section is shown in Fig.5.It consists essentially of a gyrating crushing head (521) working inside a crushing bowl (522) which is fixed to the frame (501).
