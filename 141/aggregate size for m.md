## Sieve analysis
A sieve analysis (or gradation test) is a practice or procedure used (commonly used in civil engineering) to assess the particle size distribution (also called gradation) of a granular material by allowing the material to pass through a series of sieves of progressively smaller mesh size and weighing the amount of material that is stopped by each sieve as a fraction of the whole mass.Concrete Mix Design Step by Step full Calculationconcrete mix design full calculation,finding out qunatity of cement,sand and aggregate,Free Download Mix Design Excel Sheet Estimated water content for mix = 186+ (3 100) x 186 = 191.6 kg m 3 Step 4 : Selection of Cement Content for mix: Water cement

## What's the best size of coarse aggregate in concrete in …
Generally the size of coarse aggregate used is 12.5 mm.If we use the proportional mix of different sizes small to large (&gt;4.5 mm to 20 25 mm),this make the concrete structure compact by align.Maximum aggregate sizeI'm looking at a cantilever concrete column and the spacing of the vertical bars is getting closer than I would like.I would like to use a 3 4&quot; maximum aggregate size.Several questions come to mind and I admit I've never really given them much thought.I have.

## Aggregates
Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock,boulders,cobbles,or large size gravel.Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases,soil cement,and in new concrete.After harvestingWhat is the effect of coarse aggregate size in compressive …When we design mix the concrete,its target strength is much less than the compressive strength of the aggregates used in the formation.It can also be clearly seen in the mix design procedure that greater the maximum size of coarse aggregate use.
