## Abrasive blasting
Micro abrasive blasting is dry abrasive blasting process that uses small nozzles (typically 0.25 mm to 1.5 mm diameter) to deliver a fine stream of abrasive accurately to a small part or a small area on a larger part.Generally the area to be blasted is from about 1 mm 2 to only a few cm 2 at most.at most.Advanced Materials TechnologyAdvanced Materials Technology strives to build size reduction equipment at competitive prices without sacrificing quality or performance.We use the most advanced air classification systems to achieve product performance and enable control of finished products in the 1 to 5 micron range.
