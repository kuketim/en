## Effect of Ultrafine Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag …
This paper explores deep into the effects of mineral admixtures,e.g.ultrafine ground granulated blast furnace slag (UFGGBFS) and copper slag (CPS),on ambient cured geopolymer concrete (GPC).First,a GPC was prepared from mineral admixtures like the UFGGBFS,fly ash and the CPS,and alkali activators like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium silicate (Na 2 SiO 3 ).Effect of microsilica on properties of aluminum magnesium.10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The ultrafine high purity amorphous silica was observed to have a spherical shape under an electron microscope,amorphous and amorphous,and an average particle diameter of 0.2 μm.It has excellent physical and chemical properties.
