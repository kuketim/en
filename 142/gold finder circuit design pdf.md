## AN 295,Gold Code Generator Reference Design
2 Altera Corporation AN 295: Gold Code Generator Reference Design The main principle of spread spectrum communication is using wideband,noise like signals to increase the bandwidth occupancy.As a result of larger bandwidth,the power spectral density isMetal Detector using a 2 Pulse Induction Coiladdition to this,the circuit design had to be relatively simple and compact so as to fit on a size limited Printed Circuit Board (PCB) board (due to the use of the EAGLE PCB layout tool).Background A typical metal detector used for detecting buried coins,gold
