## Top Titanium Producing Countries
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;6.India.India produces the sixth most titanium in the world at 500 metric tons in 2013.India is home to major rutile deposits which are one of the primary minerals that bear titanium.There are abundant reserves of these deposits in concentrated producing areas,but they feature a lower grade of titanium concentrates than other primary minerals.Tailoring TiO2 Treatment Chemistry To Achieve Desired.Titanium dioxide can be produced in either anatase or rutile crystal form.Both can be made by the older sulfate process.The chloride process produces only the rutile crystal form.The rutile crystal form exhibits better durability than the anatase,making rutile a
