## 40d:Bituminous coal
One of the two mineral sources of fuel,bituminous coal is found in veins in sedimentary layers.When processed at a smelter or magma smelter,one unit of bituminous coal produces 3 units of coke.If done at a regular smelter,this processing requires one pre existing unit of fuel (either charcoal or coke),leaving a net production of 2 fuel.Bituminous coalBituminous coal or black coal is a relatively soft coal containing a tarlike substance called bitumen or asphalt.It is of higher quality than lignite coal but of poorer quality than anthracite.Formation is usually the result of high pressure being exerted on lignite.Its coloration can be black or sometimes dark brown; often there are well.
