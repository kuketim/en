In recent decades,research has demonstrated that high dosage levels.(40% to 60%).For any given situation there will be an optimum amount of fly ash that can be.grinding mills before being blown with air into the burning zone of the boiler.In this.lower water content when compared to a portland cement concrete.PRODUCT DATA SHEET GENERAL PURPOSE,• To achieve optimum performance in concrete or other,• It is not normally necessary to use a mortar plasticiser with limestone based General Purpose Cement,but where used a lower dosage than normal is suggested,It is essential to use the correct materials,proportion and mix the materials properly,add the correct amount of water.

## Clay dosage and water cement ratio of clay cement grout.
In general,higher clay dosage and lower water cement ratio improved the stability and led to lower permeability of the clay cement grout but led to a poor performance in terms of fluidity and strength.A methodology was proposed for determining the optimum clay dosage and water cement ratio to fulfill various field demands.Basic Grinding Aid gcpat201777&ensp&#0183&enspThe dosage rate of NRG will depend on the fineness and the reagglomeration characteristics of each cement.Typical dosage rates will vary from 0.02% 0.06% by weight of cement for Types I &amp II cements and from 0.04% 0.08% by weight of cement for Type III cements.The optimum dosage rate must be determined during full scale cement mill tests.
