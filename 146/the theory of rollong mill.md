## Strip Thickness Control of Cold Rolling Mill with Roll,
In rolling mill,the accuracy and quality of the strip exit hickness aret very important factors To realize high,Define the theory for prediction of specific roll force is central to the development of a model for tandem cold rolling Referring to,which approximatelyRolling1.2 Rolling mills: Rolling mill consists of rolls,bearings to support the rolls,gear box,motor,speed control devices,hydraulic systems etc.The basic type of rolling mill is two high rolling mill.In this mill,two opposing rolls are used.The direction of rotation of the rolls can be changed in case of
