14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mine dewatering techniques.Dewatering and groundwater control is an important part of many open pit and underground mines.Effective dewatering is a pre requisite for safe and efficient mining.Poorly controlled groundwater will waste money,slow down mining and potentially cause adverse environmental impacts.However,techniques are available to successful control groundwater.Surface mining is often preferred to subsurface mining by companies in the industry because it is less expensive,there are fewer complications with electricity and water,and it is safer.However,surface mining can be more environmentally damaging than subsurface mining.Types of Surface Mining Open Pit MiningHow can metal mining impact the environment? …17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Open pit mining disturbs larger areas than underground mining,and thus has larger visual and physical impacts.As the amount of waste rock in open pit mines is commonly two to three times the amount of ore produced,tremendous volumes of waste rock are removed from the pits and deposited in areas nearby.Waste piles from processing,such as.24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;cannot usually be mined economically by underground methods; open pit mining is the most efficient way of developing such ore bodies.In most cases,more waste is generated during open pit mining than underground mining.This can be considered a positive aspect of open pit mining as it makes better use of the resource.Waste minimisation concepts

## Mine water management
21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;1 Mining personnel have a different interpretation of the term “mine water management”.For the rock mechanics engineer it is the de pressurisation of a slope in an open pit,for the metallurgist it might pertain to the water contained in the process circuit,and for the tailings engineer,the waste circuit.Open pit mining often involves the removal of natively vegetated areas,and is therefore among the most environmentally destructive types of mining,especially within tropical forests.Overburden (also called waste or spoi l) is the material that lies above an area with economic or scientific interest.
