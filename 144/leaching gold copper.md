The concept of leaching copper gold ores using leach solutions which contain Cu(CN) 3 2− was investigated.Gold leaching occurs in air saturated Cu(CN) 3 2− solutions at a much slower rate than in free cyanide solutions.A similar gold leach rate is observed when copper is alloyed with the gold.The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching An …Leaching gold with a cyanide solution remains the most widely used hydrometallurgical process for the extraction of gold from ores and concentrates.Despite the difficulties and hazards of working with cyanide,no other process has yet been proven to be an economic viable alternative.

## Biooxidation Thiosulfate Leaching of Refractory Gold.
A process of biooxidation followed by thiosulfate leaching of gold from refractory gold concentrate was investigated.Mineralogical studies on the concentrate showed that very fine gold grains (10 μm) were encapsulated in pyrite and arsenopyrite,while the amount of monomer gold was only 21%.The gold bearing sample was identified as a high sulfur fine sized wrapped type refractory gold.8 Microbial Leaching of Metals15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;natural sciences,Plinius describes how copper minerals are obtained using a leaching process (K&#214;NIG,1989a,b).The translation reads ap proximately as follows:“Chrysocolla is a liquid in the before mentioned gold mines running from the gold vein.In cold weather during the winter the sludge freezes to the hardness of pumice.

## Gold Cyanide Leaching Process,Gold Cyanidation Process
It includes the stages such as leaching pulp preparation,leaching and adsorbing,gold removal carbon recycling,pulp agitation,and gold loaded carbon desorption.【Application】: It suits for large gold mines with high grade gold and gold deposits associated with higher concentrations of silver and copper.Application of SART to Heap Leaching of Gold Copper16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;for copper leaching is 0.1 kg NaCN t.If the quantity of copper extracted increases to 300 g t then the cyanide requirement increases to 0.7 kg NaCN t.Viewed another way,since the 3 moles of cyanide that are complexed with each mole of copper in the leach solution are effectively “inactive” as far as gold leaching is concerned,the Maricunga
