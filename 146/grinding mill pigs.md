## Cregg Mill
Cregg Mill is a converted 18th century watermill in the townland of Drumgriffin,near Corrandulla village in County Galway,Ireland,approximately 9 miles (14 km) from Galway City.The mill serviced the local area,including neighbouring Cregg Castle,and served as a feeding centre for the poor of CorrandullaAllAboutFeedParticle size in pig feed matters.This article describes how the particle size structure of a pig feed mixture with a high barley content can be optimised by means of stage grinding with a hammer mill and a downstream crushing roller mill.13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;roller mills in grinding barley and wheat for growing pigs.In addition to mill type,the effects of fineness of grinding within each mill type were studied on digestibility,nitrogen utilisation (experiments 1 and 2),performance and carcass quality of growing finishing pigs (experiments 3 and 4).2.Material and methods 2.1.Grinding methods

## Effect of Mill Type and Particle Size Variation on Growth.
The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of mill type used to grind corn and its particle size variation on diet flowability and subsequent finishing pig growth performance and carcass characteristics.A total of 200 pigs (DNA Line 241Is a hammer or roller mill better for pig feed structure?“If pig feed is used in mash form,the most convenient method for particle size reduction,considering targeted particle size and specific energy consumption of the grinding process,is to combine a hammer mill and roller mill.“However,if pig feed is used in pelleted form,the best option is to apply coarse grinding on [a] roller mill.

There are many different methods for processing feed for pigs.In addition to grinding,the most common forms of feed processing are pelleting,extruding,and roasting.Pelleting.
