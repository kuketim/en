## Cement Manufacturing Process Phases Flow Chart.
Cement Manufacturing Process Phase IV: Kiln Phase.Kiln is a huge rotating furnace also called as the heart of cement making process.Here,raw material is heated up to 1450 ⁰C.This temperature begins a chemical reaction so called decarbonation.In this reaction material …rapid hardening cementThis cement lowers the setting time and accelerates hardening process.This great cement gives strength about 25% more than rapid hardening cement at two days.The strength of this cement is nearly same to Portland pozzolana cement.This extra rapid hardening cement is prepared by grinding calcium chloride with Portland cement.But using limit.
