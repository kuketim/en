5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Coal is a combustible black or brownish black sedimentary rock,formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements; chiefly hydrogen,sulfur,oxygen,and nitrogen.Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.Abandoned Mine Drainage Chartiers GreenwayEvaluation of Mine Discharges from Abandoned Coal Mines in the Lower Chartiers Creek Watershed and Restoration Plan for Large Mine Discharges to.It has the highest iron and second highest manganese content,and with its high flow accounts for the highest acid and iron loading (half of all of discharges combined).
