## Refining of Gold at the Rand Refinery
26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;On 27 November 1920,Rand Refinery Limited was registered as a private company with initial capital of &#163;50000,raised from shares limited to gold mining companies that were members of the Transvaal Chamber of Mines.A further &#163;165 000 was borrowed and secured by registered debentures.What are the main methods of mining? American.7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;There are four main mining methods: underground,open surface (pit),placer,and in situ mining.Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels,beach sands,or other environments.In situ mining.
