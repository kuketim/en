DRI produced with coal based reductants (for example in rotary kilns) make up roughly 25% of DRI produced in the world.It was found that SL RN DRI samples from a kiln cooler had high nitrogen contents ( 250ppm,depending on particle size),higher than DRI from gas based reduction.2G Direct ReductionThe SL RN process,which utilizes rotary kiln to reduce lump ore,pellets and sand iron with coal,is in commercial production.This process suffers,however,from relatively big heat loss and facility size,and hence finds limited acceptance of 2 million tons year.
