## Complex utilisation of ekibastuz brown coal fly ash: Iron.
To improve the above situation,a combined ash treatment process was developed for utilisation of the coal fly ash waste from coal fired power stations.The ash treatment includes three stages: 1) magnetic separation of an iron containing fraction,2) carbon separation by floatation,and 3) extraction of aluminum by the autoclave hydrochloric acid leaching.Evaluation of the use of an alkali modified fly ash as a.However,the raw fly ash exhibits a low adsorption capacity than synthetic products.In addition,the raw coal ash can be used only when the fly ash is alkaline in nature.Use of coal fly ash containing high unburned carbon can be a more suitable adsorbent for the removal of metals because of its high surface area and low cost (Wang and Zhu 2007).

## A Study of Ferrospheres in the Coal Fly Ash
Coal fly ash is an industrial by product,produced from coal combustion in thermal power plants.It is the most complex anthropogenic materials,which consists of combination of minerals originated from different sources.Coal fly ash and its byproduct has become an environmental concern over the World.Therefore,there is a pressing and ongoing need to investigate the structures and some.Concrete ProductsThe company's Module 2 method leaches fly ash by separating insoluble silica and solubilizing most of the remaining elements or compounds.The latter are then sequentially precipitated into calcium carbonate,aluminum hydroxide,iron oxide,and magnesium hydroxide,plus a concentrate bearing rare earth elements recoverable through more advanced processing.
