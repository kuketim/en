## Sedimentary rock Iron rich sedimentary rocks Britannica
Two major types of iron rich sedimentary rocks are recognized: (1) iron formation,or banded iron formation —regionally extensive,locally thick sequences composed of alternating thin (millimetre to centimetre thick) layers of mainly crystalline textured iron rich minerals and chert—and (2) ironstone—noncherty,essentially clastic.gravity ncentration for iron ore beneficiationBeneficiation of Iron Ore Mineral Processing Metallurgy Crushing and GrindingHydroclassification and Magnetic FinishingConditioning and FlotationSilica Flotation ReagentsThickening and FilteringAdvantages of Flotation Crushing is done in the conventional manner in 2 or 3 stage systems to approximately all minus &#190; inch which is considered good feed for subsequent wet rod and ball mill.
