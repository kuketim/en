In addition,smaller particle size limestone dissolves much faster than large particle size limestone (Walk et al.2012; Kim et al.2014),creating more opportunity for the Ca to interact with P.Effects of Particle Size Distribution on the Burn Ability.Heat and mass transport phenomenon govern the calcinations of limestone and depicts the individual steps of calcium carbonate calcinations.[17] and [18] showed that calcinations time increases with increasing particle size distribution.The surface area of the calcium oxide has been found to be directly proportional to the extent of calcium oxide reactivity towards CO 2 [19].

## Effects of the Limestone Particle Size on the Sulfation.
Limestone particle size has a crucial influence on SO 2 capture efficiency,however there are few studies on the sulfation reactivity,which covers a broad range of particle sizes at low SO 2 concentrations.In this paper,a large capacity thermogravimetric analyzer (LC TGA) was developed to obtain the sulfur removal reaction rate under a wide range of particle sizes (3 μm 600 μm) and SO 2.Limestone particle attrition and size distribution in a small …Limestone particle attrition was investigated in a small circulating fluidized bed reactor at temperatures from 25 to 850 C,1 atm pressure and superficial gas velocities from 4.8 to 6.2 m s.The effects of operating time,superficial gas velocity and temperature were.
