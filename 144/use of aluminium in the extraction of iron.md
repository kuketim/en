## Aluminium
Aluminium (aluminum in American and Canadian English) is a chemical element with the symbol Al and atomic number 13.It is a silvery white,soft,non magnetic and ductile metal in the boron group.By mass,aluminium makes up about 8% of the Earth's crust,where it is the third most abundant element (after oxygen and silicon) and also the most abundant metal.IRON AND STEEL7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This page looks at the use of the Blast Furnace in the extraction of iron from iron ore,and the conversion of the raw iron from the furnace into various kinds of steel.The common ores of iron are both iron oxides,and these can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke.
