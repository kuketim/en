## Steel to concrete bond after concrete splitting: test …
&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The definite trend towards the use of large diameter rebars and the introduction of high strength steels (f y=500 to 600 MPa) make it necessary to study the effects of longitudinal splitting on the steel to concrete bond.The study of splitting effects requires firstly basic tests to be performed in order to gather experimental information on bond and confinement stresses acting at the bar to.Stability and Bond Properties of Latex Modified Semi.When bond rules were originally developed,experimental results were mainly obtained on normal strength concrete and a minimum relative rib area (bond index) was required by building codes to.
