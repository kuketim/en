## Cement Questions and Answers
Although all portland cement is governed by the ASTM C150 specification,all cements are most definitely not the same.First,cement can be manufactured to meet different criteria or different types.Second,even the same types of cement will vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and there may even be variation from a given manufacturer depending upon when the material was made.The Flow Characteristics of Fly Ash Slurry for Plugging.16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The fly ash has been used as a mineral admixture in Portland cement concrete in the oil field since 1950.The fly ash is known to have very similar properties to cement.Class C fly ash,especially,has high lime content,which is a cementitious component.This class C fly ash can replace cement that is primarily used in plugging abandoned wells.

## An evaluation of bottom ash from plant biomass as a.
The thermal behavior of the bottom ash and the Portland cement were determined using TGA DTA ().The results obtained for the bottom ash (Fig.1a) shows an endothermic peak located from 50 to 200 &#176;C due to dehydration of the sample and an exothermic peak from 400 to 525 &#176;C due to decomposition of the organic material in the ash,with a weight loss of 5%.Effect of Fly Ash on Mortar Mixes with Quarry Dust as …2.2.Mortar Mixes.Two control mixes,namely,1 : 3 cement sand mortar mix,QC series,with 0,20,50,and 100 percent partial replacement by weight of natural sand with quarry dust and 1 : 3 cement sand mortar mix with 20% partial replacement by weight of natural sand with quarry dust which was further modified by replacing 0%,15%,20%,25%,and 30% cement with low calcium fly ash by weight.

## Cement
Portland fly ash cement contains up to 40% fly ash under ASTM standards (ASTM C595),or 35% under EN standards (EN 1).The fly ash is pozzolanic,so that ultimate strength is maintained.Because fly ash addition allows a lower concrete water content,early strength can also be maintained.Industrial Belt Conveyors,Sand Processing Plant,Cement …Aesha Conveyors and Crushing Equipment Manufacturers,exporters and suppliers of industrial belt conveyors,sand processing plant,cement conveying system,cement dryer,coal handling system,sand processing equipment,sand washer,sand dryer,salt processing plant,fly ash handling system,material handling conveyor,vibratory screen,bucket elevator,industrial mixer,industrial crusher.
