## why do the construction company use aggregate from.
Quarries Quarry Mctigue.Construction aggregate or simply aggregate is a broad category of coarse to medium Large stone quarry and sand and gravel operations exist near virtually all population centers due to the high cost of The great majority of crushed stone is moved by heavy truck from the quarryplant to the first point of sale or use.When the size of aggregate is greater than 4.75 mm ( say 5 mm) it is called coarse aggregate.Graded aggregates are used for better particle packing.The larger the size of aggregate lesser the cement required for same strength up to certain grade.Can we replace the use of sand in Cement Concrete …Yes,Definitely,But not with stone dust.Stone dust is quarry dust.It is not good for concrete.Use M sand or Manufacturer sand.M sand and stone dust are not same.M Sand is graded,it is manufactured by selected stones to suit concrete.But S.4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;IMPORTANCE OF SUB GRADE PREPARATION FOR HIGHWAYS ROADS.adequate density is specified as a relative density for the top 150 mm (6 inches) of subgrade of not less than 95 percent of maximum.
