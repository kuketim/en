What Is Volume Batching of Concrete? Batching of concrete means measuring different ingredients of concrete (i.e.cement,sand,coarse aggregate and water) before mixing it.When this measurement is done on the basis of volume,we call it Volume Batching.Below are mentioned some of important points to remember before adopting volume batching method in …Concrete Mix Design ReportThis data can be useful in diagnostics if a problem occurs.7.Always adjust batching quantities to the actual moisture condition of theaggregates.8.Volume tolerance for 1m3 concrete is 1 &#177; 0.2 m3.9.Range of normal weight concrete is from 2,200 kg m3 to 2,400 kg m3 10.
