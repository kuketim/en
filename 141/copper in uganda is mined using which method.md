## Hydraulic mining
Hydraulic mining is a form of mining that uses high pressure jets of water to dislodge rock material or move sediment.In the placer mining of gold or tin,the resulting water sediment slurry is directed through sluice boxes to remove the gold.It is also used in mining kaolin and coal.How copper is madePure copper is rarely found in nature,but is usually combined with other chemicals in the form of copper ores.There are about 15 copper ores mined commercially in 40 countries around the world.The most common are known as sulfide ores in which

## The Extraction of Copper
The Process The concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica) and air or oxygen in a furnace or series of furnaces.The copper(II) ions in the chalcopyrite are reduced to copper(I) sulfide (which is reduced further to copper metal in the final stage).Copper Production: How Is Copper Made?Copper processing is a complex process that involves many steps as the manufacturer processes the ore from its raw,mined state into a purified form for use in many industries.Copper is typically extracted from oxide and sulfide ores that contain between 0.5 and 2.0% copper.

## Underground Mining Methods — New Pacific Metals
This mining method is useful because it allows for huge volumes of material to be mined at relatively low costs,which makes lower grade deposits economical to turn into mines or new pits.Many large scale open pit operations have plans to progress into block2.Mining MethodsIn each of these mining methods,various earth moving equipment including shovels,dozers,hauling trucks,and loaders are used to remove and transport the ore.However,the first step is to loosen the rock in the ore body so that it can be moved and processed.
