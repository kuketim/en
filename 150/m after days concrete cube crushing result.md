## What is the 7 days and 28 days strength of a cube test.
 · This is also called as compressive strength.For example: Suppose at a bridge site pile is being cast so to ensure that the concrete used is of designed strength or not,we take concrete cubes of size 150*150*150 mm to test strength of concrete.What is the 7 days and 28 days strength of a cube test.This is also called as compressive strength.For example: Suppose at a bridge site pile is being cast so to ensure that the concrete used is of designed strength or not,we take concrete cubes of size 150*150*150 mm to test strength of concrete.
