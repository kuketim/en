## THESIS A STUDY OF THE DURABILITY OF CONCRETE
30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Effect of Sea Water on Concrete.The durability of concrete in sea water has been a very v1idely debated question from the time that disintegration of concrete in sea water f irst became evident.Numerous investi&#173; gations and reports have been made of isolated structures inProperties of green concrete containing quarry rock dust and …and durability studies of concrete made of quarry rock dust are nearly 14 % more than the conventional concrete.The concrete resistance to sulphate attack was enhanced greatly.

## Behaviour of Concrete on Replacement of Sand with …
The strength achieved in concrete made with sand as fine aggregate achieved high strengths when compared with Quarry stone dust concrete.However,in both the cases strengths were falling at a super plasticiser dosage of 1.3% by weight of cement.Experimental Study on Concrete and Cement Plaster …28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Concrete.An attempt has also been made to durability studies on quarry rock dust when compared with the natural sand concrete.It is found that the compressive,flexural strength and durability studies of concrete made of quarry rock dust are nearly 10% more than the conventional concrete.

## Properties of green concrete containing quarry rock dust.
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;and durability studies of concrete made of quarry rock dust are nearly 14 % more than the conventional concrete.The concrete resistance to sulphate attack was enhanced greatly.Application of green concrete is an effective way to reduce environment pollution and improve durability of concrete under severe conditions.EFFECTS OF MICRO FINES ON DURABILITY OF.It was investigated that the effects of the different content micro fines in manufactured sand on the compressive strength,permeability of chloride ion and resistance to freezing in different strength grade concrete.The result shows that the effects of the micro fines on.
