## History and Technology of Watermills
Rural water mills began to close down to be replaced by the large,industrial,port based steam powered mill and by the end of the 19th Century almost all rural watermills had ceased commercial production.How Mills Work Water mills use the flow of water toWatermillA watermill is an engine that uses a water wheel or turbine to drive a mechanical process such as flour or lumber production,or metal shaping (rolling,grinding or wire drawing).A watermill that only generates electricity is more usually called a hydroelectric plant
