## Applications of Steel Slag Powder and Steel Slag …
The applications of steel slag powder and steel slag aggregate in ultra high performance concrete (UHPC) were investigated by determining the fluidity,nonevaporable water content,and pore structure of paste and the compressive strength of concrete and by.Blast Furnace SlagOther Properties Because of their more porous structure,blast furnace slag aggregates have lower thermal conductivities than conventional aggregates.(21) Their insulating value is of particular advantage in applications such as frost tapers (transition treatments in pavement subgrades between frost susceptible and nonfrost susceptible soils) or pavement base courses over frost susceptible soils.

## Calcium carbonate
Calcium carbonate is a chemical compound with the formula CaCO3.It is a common substance found in rocks as the minerals calcite and aragonite (most notably as limestone,which is a type of sedimentary rock consisting mainly of calcite) and is the main component of pearls and the shells of marine organisms,snails,and eggs.Calcium carbonate.Bulk Density: Scott Volumeter Powder TestingThe Bulk Density Tester (Scott Volumeter) is described in both Ph.Eur.and USP.It is designed for measuring the bulk density of fine powders and similar products.A comparison of the bulk and tapped densities of powders can give an indication of the type of interaction present between the various particles making up the powder mass.
