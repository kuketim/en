## Ball mills
With more than 100 years of experience in ball mill technology,Metso’s ball mills are designed for long life and minimum maintenance.They grind ores and other materials typically to 35 mesh or finer in a variety of applications,both in open or closed circuits.Synthesis of Nanomaterials by High Energy Ball MillingSmall experimental ball mills can also be completely enclosed in an inert gas glove box.As a consequence,the contamination with Fe based wear debris can be reduced to less than 1 2 at.% and oxygen and nitrogen contamination to less than 300 ppm.
