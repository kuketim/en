## ISO 23499:2013(en),Coal ? Determination of bulk density.
The present method describes a procedure for determining a reference bulk density for crushed coal such as that charged into coke ovens.When charging a coke oven,a knowledge of the mass of coal placed in the oven for maintaining a relatively constant oven charge is a requirement.The Density of Common Rocks and MineralsFor example,the density of a one inch cube of iron is much greater than the density of a one inch cube of cotton.In most cases,denser objects are also heavier.The densities of rocks and minerals are normally expressed as specific gravity,which is the density of the rock relative to the density of water.

## The Density of Common Rocks and Minerals
The densities of rocks and minerals are normally expressed as specific gravity,which is the density of the rock relative to the density of water.This isn't as complex as you may think because water's density is 1 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 g cm 3.Therefore,these numbers translate directly to g cm 3,or tonnes per cubic meter (t m 3).What is the unit weight or density of concrete? · Density of Concrete is not specified for Concrete Mix Design.It depends on the specific gravity of the materials using.As high as the specific gravity is,density of Concrete is high.If you are using the materials with low specific gravity,it.
