25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Char samples prepared in a pressurized entrained flow reactor (PEFR) at a pressure of 2.0 MPa and in a drop tube furnace (DTF) at atmospheric pressure have been examined.Chars generated in the PEFR show characteristics (e.g.morphology and internal structure) similar to those produced in a pressurized drop tube furnace (PDTF) over the pressure range of 0.5−1.5 MPa but differ significantly.Coal PreparationCoal preparation predated pulverized coal firing,particularly for stoker units where sizing has always been very important,particularly in the minimizing of fines.Predating the development of pulverized coal firing came the development of pulverizers used in the processing of minerals.
