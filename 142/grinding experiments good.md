【摘要】：Based on experiment modal analysis(EMA) and operation modal analysis(OMA),the dynamic characteristics of cylindrical grinding machine were measured and provided a basis for further failure analysis.The influences of grinding parameters on dynamic characteristics were studied by analyzing the diagnostic signals extracted from racing and grinding experiments.The significant.Model based evaluation of grinding experimentsA grinding simulation has been developed based on the population balance model.In the chemical industry,it is usual that a range of products is milled in the same grinding facility.Performing experiments with narrow fractions or tracers to obtain grinding.

## The effect of cryolite on grinding of stainless steel
In addition to the usual grinding experiments,heat treatments of 1.4301 stainless steel pins were accomplished.For this purpose,holes of 1.5 mm diameter were drilled into the pins as shown in Fig.3 and either left blank (VAa) or filled with cryolite (VAaC) as active filler.
