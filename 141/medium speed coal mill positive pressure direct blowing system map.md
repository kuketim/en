## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish black sedimentary rock,formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements; chiefly hydrogen,sulfur,oxygen,and nitrogen.Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.Ask.comAsk.com.Culture Travel Entertainment Music Movies TV Celebrities Movies.A List Actors Who Turned Down Roles in Tarantino Films.Music.The Most Talented Rock Bands of All Time,Ranked.Music.Interesting Facts About John Lennon You Probably

## Boiler (power generation)
A boiler or steam generator is a device used to create steam by applying heat energy to water.Although the definitions are somewhat flexible,it can be said that older steam generators were commonly termed boilers and worked at low to medium pressure (7 2,000 kPa or 1 290 psi) but,at pressures above this,it is more usual to speak of a.Fans: Air Flow versus Static Pressurenegative static pressure that causes resistance to air moving through a system.A mechanical ventilation system operates with the static pressure in balance.The positive static pressure created by the fans equals the negative static pressure created by resistance as air navigates obstacles in the ventilation path.2008 Housing of the Future.
