## Smelting
Smelting is the process of extracting a metal (like tin or copper) from its ore.Most ores are a chemical compound of metal with other elements,like or oxygen sulphur.Smelting uses heat and a reducing agent,like coal,to remove these other elements from the metal.Copper Smelting Process6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Introduction to Copper Smelting Techniques.Copper ore typically contains only about 0.6% of the actual copper mineral,the most common ore mined being chalcopyrite.The ore is attained using traditional methods of underground and open pit mining,the later accounting for 90% of the ore used in smelting.The ore is crushed,screened,and washed.

## smelting Definition &amp; Facts Britannica
The first metal to be smelted in the ancient Middle East was probably copper (by 5000 bce),followed by tin,lead,and silver.To achieve the high temperatures required for smelting,furnaces with forced air draft were developed; for iron,temperatures even higher were required.Smelting thus represented a major technological achievement.The Extraction of CopperExtracting copper from its ores The method used to extract copper from its ores depends on the nature of the ore.Sulfide ores such as chalcopyrite (\(CuFeS 2\)) are converted to copper by a different method from silicate,carbonate or sulfate ores.Chalcopyrite.
