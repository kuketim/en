## What is DNA?
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The structure of the double helix is somewhat like a ladder,with the base pairs forming the ladder’s rungs and the sugar and phosphate molecules forming the vertical sidepieces of the ladder.An important property of DNA is that it can replicate,or make copiesDNA: Adenine,Guanine,Cytosine,Thymine &amp; …Remember how I said that DNA polynucleotides look like half of a ladder? Well,hydrogen bonding completes the ladder.Since the nitrogenous bases can hydrogen bond,one polynucleotide can bond.
