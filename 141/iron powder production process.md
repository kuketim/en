## Powder metallurgy
Powder metallurgy (PM) is a term covering a wide range of ways in which materials or components are made from metal powders.PM processes can avoid,or greatly reduce,the need to use metal removal processes,thereby drastically reducing yield losses in manufacture and often resulting in lower costs.Powder metallurgy is also used to make.US4134800AAn improved process for producing electrolytic iron is primarily based on maintaining the electrolytic bath at a low concentration of ferrous sulfate ions in combination with a certain concentration of NH 3 and pH in the electrolytic bath.The electrolytic iron chips.
