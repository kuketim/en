## Coal mining
Most coal seams are too deep underground for opencast mining and require underground mining,a method that currently accounts for about 60 percent of world coal production.[6] In deep mining,the room and pillar or bord and pillar method progresses along the seam,while pillars and timber are left standing to support the mine roof.Coal Mining and Processing Energy Trends InsiderProcessing the Coal After coal comes out of the ground,it typically goes on a conveyor belt to a preparation plant that is located at the mining site.The plant cleans and processes coal to remove dirt,rock,ash,sulfur,and other unwanted materials,increasing.
