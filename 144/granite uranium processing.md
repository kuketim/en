16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Back to Rocks and Minerals Articles Kathy Feick Uranium is a radioactive metal with a high specific gravity which was discovered in 1789 by Martin Klaproth.It was named after the planet Uranus.Occurrence: Uranium is concentrated on the surface of the Earth since its atoms don’t fit into the crystal structure of the minerals in the mantle.Processing of Gattar Pilot Plants.Uranium is extracted effectively from the pre treated uraniumbearing granite ores after re crashing to 10 mm,using 20 g l lixiviant sulphuric acid.The dissolution of uranium in the column under acid leaching conditions reached a maximum value of 83.9%.

## Granite
According to the surface processing mode,the granite can be divided in the following four types: 1) Chip axe Slate.The surface of it is coarse,and has regular axe grains.2) Machine Planned Slate.The relative flat surface is made by the planning machine,and thegranite uranium processinggranite processing plant in europe Coal mining processing plant in Nigeria.This coal mining project is an open pit mine located in Nigeria,announced by mining company Western Goldfields that it has discovered 62,400,000 tonnes of proven reserves of coal.
