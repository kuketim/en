## Copper
Copper is a ductile,coloured metal that has very high thermal and electrical conductivity.Copper was the first metal to be used by man (probably as early as 7000 BC) and was used as a substitute for stone; its malleability enabled tools to be easily shaped by.Copper Purification ProcessIn large copper plants the main contaminant in the electrolyte is nickel.Copper Cathode Sheets: also called “the negative terminal”.Thin “starter sheets” of highly pure copper foil (sometimes stainless steel sheet) are used as the cathodes,placed in between the
