## Casting (metalworking)
4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In metalworking and jewellery making,casting is a process in which a liquid metal is somehow delivered into a mold (usually by a crucible) that contains a negative impression (i.e.a dimensional negative image) of the intended shape.The metal is poured into the mold through a hollow channel called a sprue.The metal and mold are then cooled,and the metal part (the casting) is extracted.Corrosion of Embedded MetalsCorrosion of embedded metals in concrete can be greatly reduced by placing crack free concrete with low permeability and sufficient concrete cover.Low permeability concrete can be attained by decreasing the water to cementitious materials ratio of the concrete and the use of pozzolans and slag.
