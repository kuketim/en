## Production of pure iron powder by a …
The new process for the production of pure iron powder with an iron content of the order of 99.9% is simple and can be mechanized.The resulting powder has excellent processing characteristics and in particular,as demonstrated by tests conducted at various organizations,can be successfully utilized for the production of sintered magnets,magnetic cores,high density constructional parts,etc.US4134800AAn improved process for producing electrolytic iron is primarily based on maintaining the electrolytic bath at a low concentration of ferrous sulfate ions in combination with a certain concentration of NH 3 and pH in the electrolytic bath.The electrolytic iron chips.
