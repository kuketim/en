## Grind Size &amp; Liberation for Optimum Flotation Recovery
Here is a trick for knowing if your flotation feed grind size is fine enough to achieve adequate mineral liberation without doing a full mineralogy study.If your key mineral is sufficiently liberated,it should float and be recovered in the first few minutes in an initial %mass.Identification of Optimal Mill Operating Parameters during …improve energy efficiency.The use of population balance models (PBMs) can assist in the design of mineral processing circuits and the scale up of laboratory mill results to full scale.However,since each model has its own capabilities and limitations,it is
