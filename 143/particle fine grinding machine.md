## What is the purpose of crushing,grinding and milling.
The purpose is to break the valuable mineral grains free of the gangue minerals,so that they can be physically separated from each other.This makes it possible to produce a pure mineral concentrate using processes like froth flotation or magneti.Chapter 10 Selection of Fine Grinding MillsAs for the selection of fine grinding mills,each mill has its own advantageous particle size range for the individual feed materials.Impact milling has generally its own grinding limit size of around 10 μm with typical minerals at even higher tip speed of 100 m s.Compression milling with roll mills is usually effective in the range of.
