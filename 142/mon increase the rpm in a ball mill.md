## Saw Blade Diameter,RPMs,and Rim Speed
Say 1850 RPM on motor,2 inch pulley on motor and 5 inch on arbor,then every turn of the motor gives you 2 5 turns on the arbor.2 5 times 1850 is 740 rpm on the arbor.If you have an 8 inch blade on the arbor it has a circumference (distance around) of 8 x 3.14159 or 24.9 inches so rev times distance is 740 times 24.9 or 18,426 inches per minute,or 307 inches per second or about 25.6 feet.COMMON EQUATIONS FOR OPTIMAL PERFORMANCERevolutions Per Minute Inches Per = RPM x FPT x Z Minute Surface Feet = RPM x D x.262 Per Minute = RDOC x ADOC x IPM Metal Removal Rate IPM RPM = Inches Per Revolution Feed Per Tooth IPR Z = Ball Nose Effective Diameter = D eff = 2 x R ² (R ADOC)² Ball Nose Velocity Adjustment V adj = SFM x 3.82 D eff = SFM (Surface Feet per Minute) (RPM.

## Machine Shop 2 Lathe Cutting Speeds RPM Calculations
The RPM setting depends on the cutting speed and the diameter of the part.The RPM setting will change with the diameter of the part.As the diameter of the part gets smaller,the RPM must increase to maintain the recommended surface footage.Again,take the case of the wheel.Think of the part as a wheel and the cutting speed as a distance.Mega MillionsMega Millions is one of America's two big jackpot games,and the only one with Match 5 prizes up to $5 million (with the optional Megaplier).
