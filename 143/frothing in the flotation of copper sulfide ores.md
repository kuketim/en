## Physicochemical Problems of Mineral Processing
The main problem in the flotation of Cu Mo sulfide ores in seawater is poor floatability of molybdenite at pH&gt;9.5.Froth stability plays a very important role in determining concentrate grade and recovery in flotation operations and in this paper both floatability and frothability have been tested.Zinc processingZinc processing Zinc processing Ores: Zinc ores are widely distributed throughout the world,although more than 40 percent of the world’s output originates in North America and Australia.The common zinc containing minerals are the zinc sulfide known as zinc blende or sphalerite (ZnS),a ferrous form of zinc blende known as marmatite [(ZnFe)S],and a zinc carbonate known as calamine or.

## Copper extraction Wikipedia
Copper oxide ores have occasionally been treated via froth flotation via sulfidation of the oxide minerals with certain chemicals which react with the oxide mineral particles to produce a thin rime of sulfide (usually chalcocite),which can then be activated by the froth flotation plant.Sulfide …Frothing in the flotation of copper sulfide ores in sea water …The selection of appropriate frothing agents for flotation of porphyry copper ores in sea water is becoming an important issue.In this paper a specially modified laboratory flotation.
