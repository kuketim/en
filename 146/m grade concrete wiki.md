Grade of concrete is defined as the minimum strength the concrete must posses after 28 days of construction with proper quality control.Grade of concrete is denoted by prefixing M to the desired strength in MPa.For example,for a grade of concrete with 20 MPa strength,it will be denoted by M20,where M stands for Mix.
