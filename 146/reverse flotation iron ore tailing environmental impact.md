## Flotation In Mining Iron Ore
&#183; Iron ore mining often focuses on looking for hematite deposits known as red iron ore and magnetite as they have naturally weak magnetic fields that aid in their purification Hematite however responds better to the flotation process in iron oreSignificance of Microbial Communities and Interactions in.The results suggest that empirical ecological engineering of tailing lagoons to.from a sulfidic ore body by conventional crushing,grinding,and froth flotation.These were as follows: (i) the iron and pyrite oxidizing autotrophic bacteria from acidophilic algae can minimize or reverse the impact of acid generating.
