## Particle Size Analysis for Mining and Minerals Applications …
In many cases,the valuable minerals are mixed with gangue,commercially useless material,and the ore must be separated.The first step of many separation processes is comminution (size reduction) followed by classification (separation by particle size) either for.WASH WATER OPTIMIZATION ON AN IRON ORE SPIRALSpirals have a wide appliion,they are used in iron ore processing,coal,gold,chromites,mineral sands,glass sands,and in soil cleaning.Separation on a spiral is achieved through a combination of forces that act on particles as they move down the trough of the spiral.

## Gravity Spiral Concentrator Working Principle
The gravity spiral circuit is designed to extract and concentrate "coarse gold' from the recirculating load in the mill grinding circuit and hence prevent a build up within that circuit and the eventual escape of some of that gold into the C.I.L.tanks and thereon into the final tails.Fine and Coarse Iron Ore Beneficiation An EvaluationA recent example describes an increased feed to the plant's medium (size fraction) jigs (from 126 t h to 149 t h) on average by changing bottom cutpoint from 3.5 mm square to 3.0 mm square panels.Reducing the amount of nearsized 3 x 2 mm fraction in the coarse (size fraction) jigs,increased the retention time in the fine jigs.
