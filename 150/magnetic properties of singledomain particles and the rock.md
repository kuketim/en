## Abstract
Abstract Kamacite particles (Fe Ni,Ni &lt; 5 per cent),are very common in extra terrestrial materials,such as meteorites.It is normally assumed that for kamacite particles to be reliable recorders of magnetic fields,they need to be magnetically uniform (single domain,SD) and thermally stable.Magnetic behavior of magnetite and rocks stressed to.This was used to investigate the behavior of a metamorphic rock from a region of tectonic activity.The ratio Hrc Hc and Mr Ms suggest that the mean size of the magnetic carriers is between 10 and 25 pin and that they contain both singledomain and multidomain particles,which was also apparent from the AF demagnetization curve.
