## Quantifying the energy efficiency of fine grinding circuits
In previous publications,we have described how the size specific energy (SSE) can be calculated to predict the energy required to generate new minus 75 &#181;m material.However,if we want to benchmark the performance of fine grinding where the product can be much finer than 75 &#181;m,clearly we require a finer marker size.If we do this,we also need a way to compare results that use different.EFFECT OF GRINDING METHOD ON ENERGY …1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;cement grinding which equals 30% of the total energy consumption.Furthermore,approximately 60 70% of the total electrical energy used in a cement plant is utilized for the grinding of raw materials,coal,and clinker.As a result,a small gain in grinding efficiency can have a large impact on the operating cost of a plant [ 8].
