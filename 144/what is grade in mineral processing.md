## What is the recovery in mineral processing and how …
How we calculate the recovery in mineral processing with example.For example,a lead ore that assays 5% means that in 100 kg,we have 5 kg of lead metal.If we proceed with this quantity,we will recover less than 5kg,let say we have recovered 4 kg in an amount about 10 kg of the concentrate,the recovery is 4 5%,and the grade is 4 10%.Cut Off Mine In Mineral ProcessingCut off Grades for Mineral Resource Reporting &#183; For this reason,any low grade blocks for which the grade meets the marginal cost of processing,royalties and G&amp;A at the pit rim are often stockpiled for processing late in the mine life.This cut off grade.
