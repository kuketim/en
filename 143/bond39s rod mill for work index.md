A “Bond” rod mill work index is to be determined in an apparatus with a wave liner.The author is aware of four laboratories that offer a rod mill work index test where the lining of the mill is either smooth,or smooth with a small number of primitive lifters that do not constitute a wave liner (one of the four laboratories is known to be investigating replacing the liner with a wave).Bond Rod Mill Work IndexBond Rod Mill Index Test JKTech.A Bond RMWI test is a standard test for determining the Rod Mill Work Index of a sample of ore.The BRMWI is a measure o

## Tubular Rod Mills
As in ball mills,the power draft of a rod mill is the product of capacity and work index,which is the energy required to break a mineral of a given size to the required size.The mill power is also increased by increasing the rod charge and the mill speed,while the mill power and capacity are both increasBond Ball Mill Index Test JKTechA Bond Ball Mill Work Index may also be used in the simulation and optimisation of existing mill(s) and the associated grinding circuit(s).Sample Requirements: A minimum of 8 kg of material crushed to nominally minus 10 mm is preferred.JKTech would stage crush the sample to minus 3.35 mm,as required for the Bond Ball Mill Work Index test feed.

The heavier rods acting upon the lifters and liners result in greater wear on the mill liners.Rod mills normally carry 35 to 65% rod charge by volume.The limits on charge level are (1) keeping the feed end trunnion open so that feed will get into the mill,and (2) keeping the rod charge low so rodsOrway Mineral Consultants Canada Ltd.Mississauga,ON.L4W …Index (BWi),the Rod Mill Work Index (RWi),the Crusher Work Index (CWi) and the Abrasion Index (Ai).Over the years,it has been determined that Efficiency Factors (EF1 to EF9) should be applied to
