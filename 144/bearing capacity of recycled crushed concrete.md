## Unbound crushed concrete in high volume roads.
In Norway,recycled concrete aggregate has recently been introduced in design codes for road construction,including material specifications.A number of field projects have revealed good functional properties (proven suitability),despite the fact that the mechanical properties of the materials in many cases do not comply with specifications concerning mechanical strength.Sustainable deployment of crushed concrete debris and …Load bearing capacity of the construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste was found to be satisfactory,as long as it is free of impurities and only contains concrete,asphalt and ceramic materials.Only then,recycled construction and demolition (RC&amp;D) waste aggregates can be used for road course surfacing.
