## What is Data Preprocessing?
2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Data preprocessing is a data mining technique that involves transforming raw data into an understandable format.Real world data is often incomplete,inconsistent,and or lacking in certain behaviors or trends,and is likely to contain many errors.An overview on Data Mining29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A Brief Overview on Data Mining Survey Hemlata Sahu,Shalini Shrma,Seema Gondhalakar Abstract This paper provides an introduction to the basic.together as a pre processing phase to generate a data warehouse.Data selection and data transformation can also be combined where the consolidation of the data is the result of the selection,

## dbSEABED: Data processing and mining
dbSEABED: Data processing and mining At the core of usSEABED is dbSEABED,a data mining program based on the application of fuzzy set theory to marine geological and biological data.Fuzzy set theory allows expansion of coverage of the seafloor by the use of word based data from core logs,sample descriptions,photos,and videos,as well as the more standard numeric data from a laboratory.Pengertian,Fungsi,Proses dan Tahapan Data MiningPengertian Data Mining Data Mining adalah proses yang menggunakan teknik statistik,matematika,kecerdasan buatan,machine learning untuk mengekstraksi dan mengidentifikasi informasi yang bermanfaat dan pengetahuan yang terkait dari berbagai database besar (Turban dkk.2005).
