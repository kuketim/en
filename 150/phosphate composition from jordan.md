## ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD ASSESSMENT OF PHOSPHOGYPSUM WASTE STOCKPILE MATERIAL FROM JORDAN
Abstract: Phosphogypsum is a waste by product of the phosphate fertilizer industry.The phosphate industry in Jordan has generated over 40 million tons of this waste material.Production continues at the rate of 3 million tons per year.The toxic heavy metalPhosphate rich organic manure as fertiliser : Nature …Further PROM shows equal residual effect.The results of efficiency of PROM made using two grades (+ 24% P2O5 and 34% P2O5) of rock phosphate mineral from Jordan show that low grade rock phosphate slimes are as effective as high grade phosphate

## Water Use in Jordan
Water use per sector Water use varies per sector: the agricultural sector has always been the main water user (ranging from highs of over 70% about ten years ago to about 53% in 2013),followed by the domestic sector (rural and urban households) (about 42%) and.PhosphoritePhosphorite,phosphate rock or rock phosphate is a non detrital sedimentary rock that contains high amounts of phosphate minerals.The phosphate content of phosphorite (or grade of phosphate rock) varies greatly,from 4%[1] to 20% phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5).Marketed phosphate rock is enriched (&quot;beneficiated&quot;) to at least 28%,often more than.

## Phosphate
In chemistry,a phosphate is an anion,salt,functional group or ester derived from a phosphoric acid.It most commonly means orthophosphate,a derivative of orthophosphoric acid H 3PO 4.The phosphate or orthophosphate ion [PO 4]3− is derived from phosphoric acid by the removal of three protons H+.Removal of one or two protons gives the.Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) phosphorites in Jordan: …Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) phosphorites in Jordan: implications for the formation of a south Tethyan phosphorite giant Peir K.Pufahla,*,Kurt A.Grimma,Abdulkader M.Abedb,Rushdi M.Y.Sadaqahb aDepartment of Earth and Ocean Sciences,University of British Columbia,Vancouver,British Columbia,V6T 1Z4 Canada.
