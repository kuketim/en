## Everything You Need to Know About Sandstone
Sandstone is a type of rock made from sediment — a sedimentary rock.The sediment particles are clasts,or pieces,of minerals and fragments of rock,thus sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock.It is composed mostly of sand particles,which are of medium size; therefore,sandstone is a medium grained clastic sedimentary rock.More precisely.CLASSIFICATION CHARACTERIZATION OF SOME ROCK …13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;CLASSIFICATION CHARACTERIZATION OF SOME ROCK FEATURES.Engineering characteristics of main rock material:.B.Mica or other planar minerals in continuous bands Mica schist,chlorite schist,graphite schist C.Banded silicate minerals without continuous mica sheets Gneiss.With slightly soluble cement Calcite cemented sandstone and.

Schist is a strongly foliated medium grade metamorphic rock.It is characterized by an abundance of platy or elongated minerals (micas,chlorite,talc,graphite,amphiboles) in a preferred orientation.Varieties of this rock type share similarities in appearance (schistosity) but may be highly variable in composition.Difference Between Granite &amp; Limestone SciencingDifference Between Granite &amp; Limestone.Granite is an igneous rock.As with other rocks in this category,it is formed from magma that cools and solidifies after a volcanic eruption.Granite rocks were formed when pockets of magma cooled below the Earth's surface,with the overall process taking longer than for many other igneous rocks.
