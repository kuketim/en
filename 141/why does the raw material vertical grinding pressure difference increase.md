## Pulverizer
Similar to the ring and ball mill,the vertical spindle roller mill uses large &quot;tires&quot; to crush the coal.These mills are usually found in utility plants.Raw coal is gravity fed through a central feed pipe to the grinding table where it flows outwardly by centrifugal actionUnit 2: Speeds,Feeds,and Tapping Manufacturing …If the tap does not go any further or the desired depth has been reached,release pressure on the tap; it has likely bottomed out.Remove the tap from the hole.Applying any more pressure is likely to break the tap.The smaller the tap,the more likely it is to break.

## Cement mill
A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage[1]) is the equipment used to grind the hard,nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement.Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.The Hydrostatic EquationThe Hydrostatic Equation Air pressure at any height in the atmosphere is due to the force per unit area exerted by the weight of all of the air ly ing above that height.Consequently,atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing height above the ground.

On the other hand,high infeed rates cause greater heat development in the grinding area and increase the pressure on the work,which may result in deflections and impede size and finish control.The effect of increased feed rate on the wheel is to make it actCrusherA crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
