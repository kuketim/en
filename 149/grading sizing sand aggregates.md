Fineness modulus of sand (fine aggregate) is an index number which represents the mean size of the particles in sand.It is calculated by performing sieve analysis with standard sieves.The cumulative percentage retained on each sieve is added and subtracted by 100 gives the value of fineness modulus.

## Sieve Analysis of Aggregates
Sieve analysis helps to determine the particle size distribution of the coarse and fine aggregates.This is done by sieving the aggregates as per IS: 2386 (Part I) 1963.In this we use different sieves as standardized by the IS code and then pass aggregates through them and thus collect different sized particles left over different sieves.Mineral Planning Factsheets Construction aggregatesPrimary aggregates are produced from naturally occurring mineral deposits,extracted specifically for use as aggregates and used for the first time.Most construction aggregates are produced from hard,strong rock formations by crushing to produce crushed rock aggregates or from naturally occurring particulate deposits such as sand and gravel.

## Gradation and Size
The particle size distribution,or gradation,of an aggregate is one of the most influential aggregate characteristics in determining how it will perform as a pavement material.In HMA,gradation helps determine almost every important property including stiffness,stability,durability,permeability,workability,fatigue resistance,frictional resistance and moisture susceptibility (Roberts et.Technical Note 73This technical note provides background knowledge of the requirements for aggregates for use in concrete.
