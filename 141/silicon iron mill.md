The addition of silicon to low carbon iron produces a family of silicon iron alloys,with still higher magnetic permeability.These grades all have more hardness and electrical resistivity than the irons.They have been found suitable for alternating magnetic fieldSilicon Steels and Their Applications :: Total Materia ArticleImportant physical properties of silicon steels include resistivity,saturation induction,magneto crystalline anisotropy,magnetostriction,and Curie temperature.Resistivity,which is quite low in iron,increases markedly with the addition of silicon.Higher resistivity lessens the …
