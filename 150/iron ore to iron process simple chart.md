## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? Reference.com
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining.The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however,because iron does not occur naturally,it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.The Extraction of IronCast iron has already been mentioned above.This section deals with the types of iron and steel which are produced as a result of the steel making process.Wrought iron: If all the carbon is removed from the iron to give high purity iron,it is known as wrought iron.Wrought iron is quite soft and easily worked and has little structural strength.

## Iron Ore HowStuffWorks
The most primitive facility used to smelt iron is a bloomery.There,a blacksmith burns charcoal with iron ore and a good supply of oxygen (provided by a bellows or blower).Charcoal is essentially pure carbon.The carbon combines with oxygen to create carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (releasing lots of heat in the process).Carbon and carbon.How steel is made6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;To make steel,iron ore is first mined from the ground.It is then smelted in blast furnaces where the impurities are removed and carbon is added.In fact,a very simple definition of steel is &quot;iron alloyed with carbon,usually less than 1%.&quot; The following text is taken from the Structural Manual For Ironworkers Manual V Volume I.
