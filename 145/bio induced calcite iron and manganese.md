## Subject: &quot;calcite&quot;
Microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) provides the potential for developing innovative and environmentally friendly techniques to improve the engineering properties of soil through reduction of permeability in soil and increase of soil stiffness and strength.Alkaliphilic Bacillus species show potential application.phorites,carbonates,silicates and iron and manganese oxides in the form of shells,skeletons and teeth are termed as bio mineralization (Beveridge et al.1983; Ghiorse 1984).Bio calciﬁcation involves precipitation of calcium carbonate polymorphs and occurs commonly in soil,fresh water and marine environments (Shirakawa et al.2011).

Iron can often be detected visibly in water or by staining on plumbing fixtures.There is one rule to keep in mind when selecting a method for iron removal—and that is there is no rule.You will find—as with all problem water applications— the solution is 50 percent.Alkaliphilic Bacillus species show potential application in …Bio‐mineralized calcite is likely to be more resistant to dissolution than calcite formed by inorganic precipitation as the former is less soluble (Morse 1983).Crack healing of up to 0&#183;46 mm wide cracks was recorded by Wiktor and Jonkers ( 2011 ),but the specimens were submerged in water for 100 days,in contrast to an 8‐day period used here.

## Microbial Geochemistry Reflecting Sulfur,Iron,…
Microbial populations involved in forming the distinctive precipitates of S,Fe,Mn,and Ca in the San Diego River watershed reflect an interplay between the mineralogy of the rocks in the watershed,sparse rainfall,ground and surface water anoxia,and runoff of high sulfate,treated imported water.In the sparsely developed headwaters,the Temescal Creek tributary emerges from pyrite.BiomineralizationBiomineralization refers to the processes by which organisms form minerals and is usually categorized into biologically induced mineralization (BIM) and biologically controlled mineralization (BCM).BIM is where an organism modifies the local microenvironment creating conditions that favor extracellular chemical precipitation of mineral phases.
