## How Is Platinum Extracted? Reference.com
This process is necessary because platinum,even in ore,needs to be removed from other substances.Platinum is an incredibly rare metal that is mined and extracted in a variety of different ways depending on the technological sophistication of the miners attempting to extract it.The Mining Process Waihi GoldA slurry of ground ore,water and a weak cyanide solution is fed into large steel leach tanks where the gold and silver are dissolved.Following this leaching process the slurry passes through six adsorption tanks containing carbon granules which adsorb the gold and silver.This process removes 93% of the gold and 70% of the silver.
